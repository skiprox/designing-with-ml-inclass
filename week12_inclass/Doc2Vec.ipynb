      "Installing the game was a struggle (because of games for windows live bugs).Some championship races and cars can only be \"unlocked\" by buying them as an addon to the game. I paid nearly 30 dollars when the game was new. I don't like the idea that I have to keep paying to keep playing.I noticed no improvement in the physics or graphics compared to Dirt 2.I tossed it in the garbage and vowed never to buy another codemasters game. I'm really tired of arcade style rally/racing games anyway.I'll continue to get my fix from Richard Burns Rally, and you should to. :)http://www.amazon.com/Richard-Burns-Rally-PC/dp/B000C97156/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid;=1341886844&sr;=8-1&keywords;=richard+burns+rallyThank you for reading my review!

      "While much of what has already been said is true, I just want prospective buyers to understand you Don't need to buy BI to get the \"fixes\" of the 1.3 patch. Within a few weeks they will release patch 1.3 for your Rome Total War origional game that will bring much of the issues with it into the perspective of Barbarian Invasion. You'll get the improved AI, the fix to the load/save bug and anything else that is a fix for the origional game that is now in Barbarian Invasion.Why no patch 1.3 upon release? Figure it out, this is a marketing strategy to get the \"impatient\" people to buy Barbarian Invasion to get the patch that will fix a lot of RTW now. In essence if you buy BI now you are paying for a patch and not for a whole lot more, this is merely a \"mod\" more than it is an expansion. Much like a RTR mod or SPQR mod.New \"features\" of course that are in BI will not be in a patch like \"night battles\", and of course the different factions. The campaign map is practically identical though with less on it that was in the origional RTW.Also, once you install Barbarian Invasion all your old save games will no longer function or work, while it patches everything you must start from scratch again instead of being able to play your old save games from the origional RTW.So, for those that are just inlove with RTW and Creative Assembly it's a no brainer that they/you will rush out and buy this without thought. But, for the more patient, but, perhaps unaware that there is going to be a \"free\" patch in a few weeks it's important that you know this now before buying an expansion you might not really want.\n",

      "I hope my review will add something to anyone interested in this game, or who is interested in what others have to say about it.(( At the end of my review is a way to install/play under XP ))Let me write the review not to compare this to Settlers I, II, or III.  This will simply be on how I see the game mechanics.This game seems to play quite smoothly, and it's graphics, for the time it was made, are not that bad off.  True by today's standards it won't win any awards, but it has a novel atmosphere that bodes well with the theme of the game.When playing the harder of the two difficulties, you will be challenged each mission you play, though after you have lost a few times, you will understand how the opponent will come after you and how best to set up your starting colony.  In this sense, the game is a bit onerous.Adding to the differences are the three races with different style buildings and a few unique features to each which does make it favorable to like one over the other depending on what you enjoy most.  Yet I do feel all in all, they are more or less the same.If I were to rate the music, I would say that it's catchy and you could find yourself humming it in the mudane world, but after a few hours it can be repititious.  To offset this, there is a nice in-game feature to allow you to play your own music while playing the game.  This is quite good and I do wish more games would offer this.Now, getting onto how the game operates.There are some aspects that make this a \"less then 10\" game:If you build your houses to create \"free settlers\" too close to other things, then the settlers you have not asigned will be in the way of a lot of things.  There is, sadly, no way to move them around.Sometimes 'carriers' will not grab the closest resource to them, but will travel to a further away location.  I do not see how the logic of the game tells the 'carriers' where to get there items but I do wish it were better.  Also in this, if you are a bit short on \"carriers\" and try to build something, it may take a very long time for it to get the resources it needs.Combat is frustrating because you cannot tell your troops to retreat if they are close to an enemy.  They will walk blindly into battle, even if hopelessly outmatched.There are a few other minor things but I will not mention them, as they are just personal and not, how I see it, flaws.Now, about how fun is this game?Well as some state when they review \"Homeworld\", the missions are pretty much a one shot deal.  Once you know how to win a mission and sucseed, there isn't much point in replaying it, unless you want to show someone how you did certian things.The \"free settler\" mode is also good when wanting to try out things or just to see how large and susessful you can make a colony.There \"was\" an online features for this game, but Blue Bytes doesn't seem to support the web server any longer.  You can still LAN up, I believe.  Blue Byte will still offer limmited support for this game which is also nice. (As of August 2005)Now, I really enjoy this game dispite my little quirks with it.  If feel it is a good play and should be in anyone's collection.This last part of my review will be how to make this game work with XP.  it does install and run under XP home, running a 1gig proccessor or less.  My laptop has this hardware and the game works just fine on it. However, XP pro, with a faster processor... the game won't even start.  I have found one way to make this work with higher end machines:Install the game fully (as well as any add-on disks) and install the SIV_1516.exe patch.  You can do a search for it.Do a search for Windows Application Compatibility toolkit 3.0 and install this too (it's free).  when you run it, do \"new database\" and \"fix\".  Name \"Settlers IV\"  Vendor \"Blue Byte\"Use the program and find the s4_main.exe directory and \"Operating System Modes\", pick \"none\".  Now after \"next\", in \"compatibilty fixes\", do EmulateslowCPU.  Install this new file and close out the program.  But you're not quite done.  Next use the XP compatibilty wizard and select the settlers IV exe file and select \"run with windows 98\".

      "I have played most of the prior Total Wars, but have never gotten into them very much.Computer Specs------------------------Intel Core i7 860 @ 2.80 GHz, 8 gig RAM, Radeon HD 5850Documentation------------------------I actually enjoy reading the manual for a new strategy game. Digging into how the game works encourages thinking about how to approach the game. The manual for Empire is definitely under developed. It covers some basic 'how tos', but not much else. I couldn't find information on basic game mechanics, such as how the economy works. This is a moderately complex game so the documentation should cover the mechanics of play, otherwise making intelligent choices is difficult. Fortunately there are many helpful guides on twcenter.net and the official Empire: Total War forum.My Game Setup------------------------Austria-long campaign-medium / medium difficulty.The long campaign is from 1700 to 1799, two turns per year. A 50 year campaign is also available. The two standard campaign types awards you a victory if you meet some conquest objectives. There is also a prestige campaign where you try to build up the most prestige. These are points awarded for military conquest, research, and some other criteria.The Early Game------------------------The first 30 turns or so were interesting. Making the choices of what to research and how to develop my regions was enjoyable. The battles stayed somewhat small (less than the full number of units one general can manage) so they didn't take very long.The Mid and End Game----------------------------------Once my empire started to grow the game became more tedious. Empire doesn't present information in a very usable way for empire management. Research choices become a hassle because it is tedious to collect the relevant information. Do I improve the metal working or the pottery techs? Well, I would like to know how many of each building my empire has in existence, whether they are prosperous, how much money they make, etc. There is no empire summary screen to see this information. You must either scroll around the map counting or use the arrows to jump to each town one at a time. Either way isn't ideal. If there is a more useful method, please let me know.The battles...------------------------To me the battles stayed interesting when they were on a small scale, such as 3 to 10 units per side. After that they became more of a chore to me. Obviously this is just a matter of opinion and if you enjoy the battles more than I do you probably will enjoy the game much more than myself.I also found the same basic tactics worked for me the entire game. In general I could set up my units in the corner of the deployment area. Usually I would have a modest amount of artillery (1-3 units). I would protect the arty with line infantry and have same cavalry to help mop up. I don't remember losing any battles during the campaign, but I do think I lost one or two.It seems like the AI usually brings the battle to you even when you initiated the attack. This let my defense technique described above work. When he was vastly outnumbered he tended to hang back, but if the forces were close in number he was usually the aggressor.The AI does not do a decent job attacking a fortification. It does use artillery to soften up the fortress to create some holes, but with some well placed units you can defend your fortification even if you are vastly outnumbered. His troops usually don't all arrive at the same time, so you don't need to handle a massive attack all at once.I only had one naval battle in my campaign since I stayed focused on Europe.Diplomacy and Relations-----------------------------------I am not going to describe in detail how diplomacy works, but I thought there was a good number of tools you can use to manage your relations with other countries (you can exchange technologies and regions, open trade routes, make alliances, etc). The reasons for a good or poor relationship was detailed nicely in a tool tip for each country. There were a couple things I found odd.Countries seem to forgive your territorial expansion pretty quickly. I had mine up to a -40. When I looked at it again, it was in negative single digits. I did play fairly aggressively, conquering half of the Ottoman Empire right from the start. When Prussia and Poland-Lithuania attacked me, their lands were added to Austria's growing mass.Also, when you do not honor a treaty when an ally is attacked it seems like it angers your former ally no more than other countries. A greater penalty with your former ally would make more sense.The Visuals------------------------I think Creative Assembly did a nice job on the map. It is pleasant to look at and the information is pretty clear. You can view natural choke points pretty well. To me it was occasionally difficult to notice where an army's route could be blocked by terrain. The waypoint for units is color coded, so you can see how many turns it will take for the unit to get to its destination. Region borders are color coded so you can see if you border with an enemy, an ally or a neutral country. I would have liked it if it were easier to pick out my country's border as a whole. You can use the mini map to see this, but something on the campaign map would have made it a little easier.The battle visuals are nicely done. The units have good detail to them, the terrain looks nice, and the smoke effects add some character to the battles.There were a couple of battles where the frame rate dropped to a crawl. As I mentioned above, my specs are pretty good and I didn't have my settings maxed. This rarely happened, but when it did it was pretty bad.Summary------------------------Stronger documentation would have been much appreciated. A player shouldn't be required to seek information from 3rd parties for basic game mechanics. An enjoyable early game gives way to a tedious mid to end game. The last 50 turns I turned off viewing the AI moves and hit next turn constantly. I was so far ahead I wasn't motivated to play beyond reaching my objectives. I was bored of the battles, so I didn't want to slog through any more. In fact I did auto resolve the battles once I had an overwhelming force.It doesn't appear that each country provides a substantially different experience, but that is just a guess. I think playing a naval country like England would be very different from Austria, but beyond that I think the experiences would be similar. I actually have a thread asking more experienced players about this, so I may be wrong. I think if you enjoy the battles more than myself you can get a lot more replay out of this game.Overall score (1 to 10): 6-----------------------------------I don't regret the time I spent with it, but I don't feel terribly inclined to play again. I think if you enjoy the battles, you can easily add another point or two to the score.\n",

      "I am an old veteran of the AOE series, having played both previous titles extensively in single and multiplayer. The thing that distinguishes this series from other RTS franchises (say, C&C; and Warcraft) are more or less as follows: Many more factions to pick from, more resource types & micromanagement, and the fact that AOE actually tries to be somewhat historically accurate.First off, I must admit that I'm a big fan of the fast-paced action type of RTS, a la Red Alert. This is probably one of the reasons I enjoyed AOE 3. I really don't like micromanagement (Terran was my least favorite race in Starcraft) and in previous installments of AOE I often employed trade in the market very heavily, because I just couldn't be bothered to find another dumb stone (or whatever) deposit. AOE 3 goes a long way to reducing the typical micromanagement of the series. For one, there's fewer resources, and you don't have to build gathering structures. Just get some citizens, right click on the stone (or whatever) and they get to it. They also removed the need to carefully place things like farms, since resources don't need manual delivery.The 'historical' single play campaigns in the previous games were, in my opinion, the biggest draw of the last two titles. Frankly, they were so boring it was a chore to play through them. The objectives were usually something on the order of 'capture 4 relics and move them from point A to point B,' or, when they weren't feeling particularly imaginative, 'kill everything.' AOE 3 pretty much flushes that down the toilet, and the campaign in this game is more or less a fantasy story. But the thing is, it's actually fun, and who plays computer games to learn about history anyway?A few new features include the ability to build a deck of cards, which allow you to send goods, units, and upgrades from your home city. This is tied into an experience point system. You get experience for practically everything, including just being a warm body, and these allow you to spend the cards in your deck. You can also train up to five infantry or cavalry units of the same type at once, producing them as a squad. Adding more units to a squad in training takes no extra time, so this can in fact save your hide. Additionally, some warships can train infantry and cavalry while near a shore, thus acting as a mobile base. AOE 3 also borrows a Warcraft 3 concept, in that maps are scattered with treasure protected by guardians. Kill the guardians and you can collect the loot. There is also greatly reduced emphasis on defensive structures. Forts are high level cards, so you won't be able to farm stone like mad and have one up 10 minutes into the game. Most defenses and structures are weak, and go down quickly to concentrated attacks- especially by artillery. Thus you are compelled to build a balanced standing army, which I would say is an improvement.The sounds and graphics are, as one would expect, top-notch. If you have a good machine, the detail gets truly fantastic, especially when artillery and naval units come into play. Unit balance is well done, though admittedly this might be due to the fact that many units are the same for all nations. As with most other RTS games, there is a pronounced paper-rock-scissors setup, although vast numbers of anything will generally get the job done.What's there to not like about AOE 3? Well, the main problem is the number of races. Especially if you don't count the Native American sub-factions, there are way fewer than in either of the previous games. The factions in this game aren't really more or less distinctive than those in the previous ones, so this isn't a good thing. This is going to be addressed shortly in the upcoming expansion, however, so it's not a permanent problem.The second issue is the graphics performance. AOE 3 seems to be heavily optimized for nvidia, and heavily un-optimized for ATI graphics cards. I have an ATI setup that runs The Elder Scrolls: Oblivion at 25+ FPS anywhere with max detail, but it sometimes drops into the single-digits in AOE 3 at the same resolution. Granted, this doesn't happen very often (usually in areas with tons of units and many doodads) but it really shouldn't happen at all.Lastly, if you actually like the micromanagement and quasi-historical campaign of the previous games, AOE 3 will likely turn you off. The battles are more arcade style than what you would see in, say, Rome: Total War- emphasis on impressive visual effects rather than realism.In my opinion, these changes were generally for the better, and though it does make AOE 3 a bit more 'mainstream' than its predecessors, the game is also a good deal more fun than they were. For one, those that couldn't stand the resource model and villager babysitting of the previous games in the series may want to give this one a try.\n",

      "I've written numerous reviews of this game, and I can safely say they all share the same sentiment. From the closed beta, to the current endgame TERA is Terrible.The good:Interesting character creationCombat is fun, snappy, and responsive (But is mouse targeting REALLY different than hitting tab?)Gorgeous world.The bad:Elitist playerbase.GvG (It's fun hunting a level 1 guild leader..)The empty worldThe quest system (ENJOY GRINDING JUST LIKE AION!)Elin race of little girls, that you frequently hear /local talking about in a profane manner.and much, MUCH more.TERA falls flat on it's face after getting out of the gates, the combat is very fun (Until you are killing your 8348234th monster using the same tactics as the previous 8348233). Big ass monsters are fun, and require strategy (However, this is very easy and the game boils down to how good a tank can tank, a healer can heal, and a dps can keep up dps.) The game sticks with the \"holy trinity\" of Tank, heals, dps and ensures a continued stagnation of the MMO genre.Most of what I've played in TERA (All CBTs, 2 months since release)hasn't been all bad, I had fun leveling somewhat (the grind sucks).THERE IS NO REAL ENDGAME! Unless you really enjoy doing the same 8 dungeons with HORRIBLE groups (unless you're in a guild, or better yet the popularity contest winning Vanarchy guild that controls a region) Ganking lowbies, spouting rubbish into the chat system, and generally being completely annoying when a new player asks a question is key with the playerbase here.EDIT: EME has made some changes to the US TERA recently and are releasing PVP battlegrounds shortly. The GVG kill swapping has been stopped (lol) and new things are on the horizon, however these are too little and too late for this player. I just wish they'd stop sending me emails every 3 days about their game that I no longer have a desire to play. A current glance at how the game is doing in Korea is a direct indication of how the future of TERA in the west will be. 4 servers left, and nothing but cash shop items and little to no end game content.Do yourselves a favor and look into Guild Wars 2!tl;dr- TERA is bad, and deserves to be buried by much better titles coming out in the near future.\n",

      "As I've said in other reviews/first impressions I have given, I have a mild (alright heavy) obsession with RPG games.  I have an extra special love for handheld RPGs as they allow me to stomach some of my wife's less than desirable television shows while being in the same room (I'm looking at you Bridezilla's).  So, when I found out a new Ys game was coming to the PSP, there really wasn't any option of me not getting this.Ys (pronounced eace as in Peace) is a series that has been going on for some time.  All I know of the previous iterations are that they had a nice following of fans.  I'm a late comer to the series with Ys 7 being my first foray into the red headed wonders world.  The story of Ys games usually revolve around a voiceless main character named Adol Christian with his fiery red hair and ability to woo the ladies and his heterosexual life partner Dogi the strongman with blue hair.  Usually there is some evil to conquer and in this game it's no different.  The game begins with the duo returning to Dogi's homeland where he quickly finds an old friend in danger.  Adol rescues the girl and the two are escorted back to Dogi's home village.  After some catching up, Dogi heads off into the mountains to find his former master while Adol is left to wander around.  It doesn't take long for things to spiral out of control as word of a corrupt leader searching for mysterious artifacts in the mines catches Adol's ears and he is trust into a grand adventure to save the town and the world from the evil that lurks in the surrounding areas.  Sounds epic doesn't it?  It is, but it's also standard fare.  The way this game differentiates from the others is through the excellent voice acting.That's right, there's voices.  And they are pretty good too.  The story is told from a narrators point of view describing the life and times of Adol and Dogi.  Since Adol doesn't have a voice actor, the narrator describes what he is saying to people.  Dogi does have a voice actor and it's pretty spot on to what I'd thing Dogi would sound like.  All of the other main characters in the game also have spoken lines and I found myself thoroughly enjoying them throughout the first couple hours of the game.  When people speak, a portrait pops up on screen as they speak their lines.  The portrait will change depending on mood and story while sprites in the background can be seen.  You've seen it before, but Ys: The Oath in Felghan really hits it on the head and does a great job with it.If you played Ys Seven like myself, you may find that this game is a little different.  This game is actually based on Ys III from back in the day, so I'm guessing that may have had something to do with the choice, although it's most certainly not a bad one.  You no longer walk around with two other companions receiving their help as you attack and move around the world.  Adol wanders around by his lonesome and handles puzzles and enemies on his own.  While navigating the world you will pick up different skills such as fireballs, a spinning sword trick, etc.  These help in combat, but more importantly they help you get past puzzles and world obstacles that are strategically placed in areas.  When you first come across these areas, you will have to make a mental note and return later when you have the proper means to get past it.The combat in Ys is actually pretty fun.  You are going to be spamming the X button a lot as that is how you attack.  You attack in real time and for each press of X, you swing the sword.  Hit X fast enough and you'll do some impressive moves.  Square casts magic and O allows you to jump.  That's something else about Ys, you can jump and it's a pivotal way to get around the world, especially after you acquire double jump.  Triangle sets off a boost that increases power and some of your special moves.  The combat is fast paced and very action oriented.  You'll mow through most enemies with ease, but bosses, they are another story altogether.The boss monsters in the game can vary between utterly easy and insanely tough.  The first couple bosses were pretty darn tough too.  I found myself dying multiple times and noticed something I haven't seen in many games.  If you die a lot at a boss, there is an option to decrease the difficulty.  This is awesome, especially for people who don't want to restart a game to change difficulties because they can't beat a boss.  The difficulty is ever so slightly decreased and while the challenge still remains, you are given a slight edge over the competition.  The bosses will truly test your ability to learn from the environment and the bosses cues to eliminate them.  For instance, there is a group of enemies who get stronger the more of them you kill, so you need to damage them to the point where each is hurt a lot, then whipe them out one by one to stay alive.  It's tricky, but fun to learn little secrets like this.Something that I rarely talk about in games, but in Ys is fitting is the music.  The music in Ys is awesome.  You are given the option of three different versions of the music.  The first, I believe, is from the PC release of the game back whenever it came out originally as Ys III.  The second option is a more refined cut of that old PC version which I'm guessing was in another port of it?  I didn't play the original so I'm not sure.  The final is a completely new version of the songs done for the PSP game.  It's a lot of fun to switch between them and fans of the original are going to eat this up.  I'm sticking with the new version because it sounds best but for those of you who played the original and the songs may bring back memories of playing the game, it's there and waiting for you.The Ys games are quickly becoming one of my favorite franchises on the PSP.  I wish I had played the originals back when they were originally out but I missed them.  I'm trying to make up for that now by playing every single Ys game I can get my hands on and I'm loving them all.  Ys: The Oath in Felghana is a very well made game with a lot of love and attention to detail put forth by the devs.  You can tell by playing the game that the developers really like making these games.  This isn't a game only RPG fans will like.  Actions fans will like it as well due to the heavy combat and metroid-esque upgrade system in dungeons and the world.  The game is supposed to be around 10-12 hours or so but for a PSP game, that's actually a decent length.  I'm looking forward to completing the game and will keep my eye out for any other Ys releases coming to consoles or handhelds in the future.\n",

      "Let me immediately say that LOH Trails in the Sky (or TITS as i call it ;) is a good game. If you love JRPGS and turn-based battles, certainly give it a buy. This is a PSP gem worth having. With that said, I still feel as though The Legend of Heroes has a ways to go in its battle against mediocrity. This will be a brief review that I hope to update once i've completely finished the game.Having played the original LOH games on PSP, I was never able to get more than five or six hours in. They were all generic, stale and seemed to kinda go nowhere and slowly. (at least nowhere exciting.) Sure they are decent laid back \"nothing better to do\" RPGS but with TITS there was certain hope on the horizon. Promising a deeper story lasting over fifty hours across an interesting world, better characters and a revamped battle system, TITS could easily have been the best RPG on PSP. While the game does for the most part deliver, it doesn't quite meet the expectations that XSEED initially gave me.STORYStory is without a doubt (at least to me) the most important part to an RPG. Sure the game lasts fifty hours, but if the story sucks im not going past five. I'm happy to say that TITS doesn't disappoint too much. The initial story involves two main characters as they become newly appointed \"Bracers\". Bracers uphold the peace in their own respective regions by doing everything that we've done a million times over in every other RPG. (running tedious errands, killing monsters, etc. I'll return to this later.) The two main characters are of course only like sixteen years old, set off on an adventure to become full fledged bracers and because of this the game never gets too mature. BUT it does have some surprises up its sleeve, especially for a LOH game. The game does end up playing out some interesting plots and character evolution. There's plenty of humor and enjoyment to be had and so far it's been a fun ride but it takes quite a while to really get going and even after it does it can feel quite generic at times. Still It's definitely one of the best RPG outings on PSP and if you devote the time you'll find a lot to love and a story that's not half bad. BUT before you even think about buying this game you need to ask yourself one question: DO YOU LIKE TO READ?TITS has gotten a lot of attention due to its very extensive script. Is that a bad thing? Hell no. Xseed should be commended for getting this little epic stateside and on the PSP system. But many times conversations do feel a bit dragged out and you and the circle button (which allows to to click thru text faster) will get acquainted real fast. I don't mind there being a lot of text at all but only if it's warranted. I found a lot of conversations to drag on after points and objectives were made quite clear. But there is a lot of quirky/funny character-driven text that I did very much so enjoy.BATTLE SYSTEMThis is one area that TITS really shines in my opinion. The LOH battle system has been completely revamped and for the better. It's much more strategy oriented now, a bar on the left that shows the turn order of the battle. (kinda similar to the Final Fantasy X battle system) Once it gets to your turn, your actions will occur immediately as opposed to previous systems where you choose everyones commands at once and watch the turn execute. (Altho certain commands, such as magic, might not occur immediately based on the order and how long it takes to prep) But there's a bit more to it.Different from other turn-based systems, movement is a factor. Now don't get the wrong idea. It's not like Final Fantasy tactics or something where you're constantly telling your character which block to walk to. For the most part you're still just choosing commands and selecting the enemy to use them on. Its just now your character can only move so far, so if an enemy is on the opposite side of the field you'll either have to just movie in closer or do a ranged attack. Not only that there are turn bonuses that grant you or the enemy benefits (And by killing an enemy you inherit their turn bonus) like STR up HP regain. This allows for a much more entertaining, involving and rewarding system that I'm still loving.Another key element is Orbments. These little items can be equipped and grant magic abilities and stat boosts. As you progress through the game you of course receive more (thru shops and thru the course of the game) as well as the option to open up new slots, which allows you to equip them. It's not exactly a brand new system but that's ok. It's still quite fun and theres a bit more to it but i wont cover the little details here. Just play the game!PRESENTATIONThis is the real low point of the game. The one thing I always liked about the first three LOH games on PSP was the presentation. Sure the graphics weren't mind-blowing but they still managed to look vibrant and pretty. The 3d world was detailed, colorful and fun to explore, the 2d character animations were nice and moving the characters around with the analog stick just felt smooth. (for a PSP game at least) All of the things I just mentioned have unfortunately been downgraded in TITS. The 2d characters dont look too bad but theyre much smaller and more... cute-like and just not as detailed. The character movement just feels more blocky than the first games and doesnt look nearly as good, (more like the characters are in a brisk powerwalk when you move around). The cool lighting and water effects from the other LOH games are out and replaced by bland textures. Now in a game like this, graphics are the least important thing in my opinion. Are the graphics great? no. Are they the worst ive seen on psp? No no no. Should you still buy the game? Yes yes yes. If you're playing for graphics then you're playing for the wrong reasons anyway. Just don't expect extremely impressive visuals.Now one thing I just don't understand is how everyone LOVES the music of LOH games so much. The music is definitely not horrible and at times maybe a little above average, but for the most part it's kinda just your typical RPG 101 selections. I grew up being a film fiend, listening to the classic orchestrations of John Williams, James Horner, etc. (not that im comparing TITS's music to the Schindler's List soundtrack. Just showing I'm used to different things.) As for gaming music I have many of Nobuo Uematsu's soundtracks, a few other random selections (Xenogears, Crono Trigger/Cross, etc) and TITS isnt anything near that kind of caliber music. in my opinion it's real hit or miss. While some tracks are well done and nice, others (like the battle theme which is more laid back and jazzy than I would have personally liked) just strike me as kinda annoying and when you hear em over and over they get real old. Now maybe it just comes down to personal preference. I like more serious, orchestrated themes. If you're a fan of lighthearted jazzy JRPG tunes then you'll probly love it.CLOSING COMMENTS(hopefully I didnt forget anything. I'm going to try and update this review when I'm 100% through the game so i can give a TITS master opinion.)OK so it comes down to one question: are you a JRPG fan? If yes, get this game. For $30 bucks this is a great adventure and one of the best RPG experiences on the PSP. Xseed went through a lot of work to get this game to our shores and I admire anyone in this sad age of turn-based JRPG decline that fights the good fight and keeps putting out 50hrs++ adventures. Its still not revolutionary by any means but its fun, engaging and rewarding. Pick it up and support the PSP/Xseed/JRPGS!\n",

      "Final Fantasy IV on the DS is mostly a fun game that goes very light on the story, which sometimes borders on the absurd.If you come from the great era of computer RPG's AND have played japanese RPG's, then you know what to expect: there is no element of choice, there is a big focus on level advancement even though your stats are determined automatically, your role is already pre-determined and nothing you can do changes the outcome of events, and, finally, battles play an immense role.** STORY **Most people like RPG's because these are games that, usually, can tell a good tale.  Well, this is not such game.  The story starts out fine and poses and interesting dilemma: you are a knight sent on a dark quest that raises suspicions about the king's judgement even in a loyal soldier such as yourself.  After a few events, you are forced to take on a rather personal mission to find out what is happening behind the throne which will lead to a wild, ridiculous series of events involving an ancient evil, companions that come and go and give their lives for your cause so easily that they make dying look fun, and all sorts of beasts and locations taken from a wild mix of all the world's mythologies.  Basically, put in a measure of every mystical tale you've heard, every mystical location you know of, and a few crazy, wild tales in a container and mix thoroughly.After playing this game for a while, nothing will surprise you anymore.  You will have seen all sorts of absurd creatures and events and will have traveled above and below.  I seems to me like this story was written by a 12 year old.  I kept expecting to battle ninja-robot-wizards, but I guess they weren't trendy in '91.Don't get me wrong, it's kind of entertaining if you, like me, like fantasy.  Don't expect a grandiose tale though, because this isn't one.** GRAPHICS, SOUND, MUSIC **Being a DS remake of the original FFIV (FFII on the SNES), it features updated graphics now in 3D polygons.  Visual quality is very appealing, but the character models are somewhat lacking.  Your characters look like munchkins instead of great heroes, especially when confronted by a boss enemy, that literally towers above you.Sound quality is pretty good for DS standards, and the game even has fully-voiced animated cutscenes.  Voices are very well done by professional voice actors, and the animations are very fluent and well executed, in a cartoonish sort of way (don't get me wrong, it's great!).Music is pretty standard JRPG-score.  A lot of tunes are somewhat tacky if you will excuse my opinion.  But then again, this is a 20-year old game with a new wrapping.** GAMEPLAY **In general, the game is fun and exploration is rewarding (literally!).  You will see a big variety of locations and battle a huge assortment of enemies.  There is too much focus on battling, however.  As most JRPG's this one goes light on the role-playing and heavy on the tactical battling.Now, this is the most annoying aspect of this game.  While the battles are really fun and demand an effective strategy, you will be facing random encounters every two or three steps no matter where you are: outdoor, dungeons, caverns, palaces, more dungeons, etc.  For practical purposes there is no way of avoiding them(*) and you won't see them coming.  It's like you hit an invisible enemy that suddenly materializes in front of your eyes.  This isn't too bad since you have to grind-for-your-life: enemies will get really strong and you'll have to spend a few hours actually searching for random encounters to increase your level, which in my opinion completely breaks game and story immersion.  In other JRPG's such as Square's own Chrono Trigger, you don't have to do nearly as much level grinding, so you can enjoy the story and feel like what you do has some kind of significance.Excessive random battling is game breaking in an RPG, in my opinion.  These many battles and the necessity to grind levels separate you from the story which you will be playing at intervals, making this an unnecessarily long game.(*) There is a way of avoiding random encounters, but getting it is itself MORE annoying than random battles, as you need a particular item with a drop rate of less than 1%.** FINAL THOUGHTS **While the game itself can be rewarding and entertaining, there are certain design problems with this game that make it feel very frustrating at times.  This version includes a Quicksave option (a-la Castlevania: Order of Ecclesia) that lets you save a temporary file anywhere you are in the game, but deletes itself upon loading.  Some save points are set way too sporadically, making you replay a couple of hours if you happen to die from an unusually strong random encounter or simply make a mistake.All in all, an entertaining game, but not the greatest one I've played that's for sure.  Then again, we computer RPG fans were really spoiled in the 90's, so my RPG standards are set too high.If you have a DS/DSi, you like cheesy fantasy, don't have any other RPG to play on the DS and have a bunch of hours to burn, then sure, get this game.  Why not?\n",

      "Well, I'm always up for a good RPG.  When I saw this come out some time ago, I was mildly interested, but I had a ton of other games to get to in the backlog, so I mostly ignored it.  Then I noticed the overflow of gushing positive reviews, and also, subsequently, the insane scarcity and price inflation of this game.  Then, of course, I thought \"oh my gosh, I'd better grab one before they end up getting so expensive that it costs $300 and a kidney just to get one!\".  That's when I procured my very own copy from the Wild West land of ebay - only to have it sit on a shelf for a couple months.  Yes, I was still very much mired in that backlog I spoke of earlier.  No matter, though, I've gotten to it now!  So, having gotten so expensive in such a short amount of time, I've got great expectations for this game!  This must be the greatest RPG ever!!!  Or at least it has to be a a decent one...Graphics (score 8/10): Radiant Historia features 2-D sprite animations that'll seem instantly familiar to anyone who's played a lot of older RPGs (such as Final Fantasy VI or Lunar: Silver Star Story).  I must say, for using 2-D sprites the animations look great!  They may be remniscent of older games, but they are wholly modern in their lovely crisp details.  As for the environmental graphics, they are not bad at all considering the system.  The environments have great amounts of detail in them and a great sense of size and scale is achieved despite the small screen size of the DS.  Also, whenever anyone speaks, a portrait with their name pops up so you can see detailed versions of what the characters look like.  I rather like this stylistic choice because it makes it easy to see what characters really look like, and it helps the simpler-looking sprites not feel so graphically limiting.  As for the art style itself, anyone who's ever played an RPG of Japanese origin in their life can clearly see the anime influence in the art style.  Some people may not enjoy this type of art style, but I love it so I was quite pleased.  Lastly, I should mention that there aren't any pre-rendered \"cutscenes\" per se, as all the scenes are played out with in-game character models/graphics only.  Some people might think this would make the game boring, but I hardly noticed it at all because the in-game graphics are handled so well.  In fact, I was almost too caught up in the great storyline to notice...Music (score 9/10): No voice acting here, but that's okay.  As for the background music, it's great!  There's a good variety of musical tracks, and they are all sufficiently complex and interesting to keep them from getting boring.  It's not the greatest soundtrack of all time or anything, but it's darn good!Characters (score 9/10): I just came out of playing Final Fantasy XIII recently, and just let me say that I never thought I'd have to start an RPG with the immediate litmus test question of \"do I hate these characters?\"  You can probably guess that FFXIII was not a great experience for me, but at least I've now got a newfound appreciation for characters who don't make you want to kill them within the first 30 minutes of gameplay.  But enough about FFXIII - I'm very happy to say that I like the characters of Radiant Historia.  I like Stock, the protagonist - he's a quiet aloof guy but not a complete jerk either.  I like everyone else who joins the party later too.  I even like Aht, who's a child character - and most child characters in games are annoying beyond all reason!  I also felt that there was a lot of subtle but good characterizations - I got a feel for everyone's personalities without them being shoved down my throat.  As for the villains, they are quite good too.  I like the fact that there is more than one villain and they all have varied motivations for doing what they do - and they don't always line up with each other.  It made their interactions with each other seem more complex and realistic.  There are even distinctive NPCs (like Kiel) who pop up in the story, many of whom I became attached to.Story (score 8/10): You start off as Stocke, a member of a Military Intelligence organization who does secret missions.  It's during the middle of a war in which an evil empire is constantly trying to invade your small country.  Now Stock and his allies must find a way to defeat the empire and save their country...and the world.  Does this story sound familiar?  Maybe from every old-school RPG ever made?  Yeah, you might be thinking that this doesn't sound very original at all and must therefore be quite boring.  You'd be wrong!  While the setup seems very clich&eacute;, Radiant Historia quickly shows the player that they have a few new tricks up their sleeves.  In fact, the biggest point of interest is the introduction of time travel.  It's not the traditional time travel you may be thinking of, but instead you get to experience two different branches of history based on what decisions you make throughout the game.  These are not simple story branches leading to multiple endings either; you literally need to play both branches to get further in the game since what you do in one branch can affect the other.  I had a ton of fun seeing what results my alternate choices made in the historical timeline, and it doesn't feel like tedious backtracking too much (although sometimes it does get slightly confusing remembering what you did in one timeline vs the other).  Overall, I'd say this game puts a fresh spin on what could've been a dull and overworn plot concept, and the story is solid and entertaining enough to keep one engaged the whole way through.  As a side note, I'd like to mention that this game has absolutely no romance in the main plot - which is amazing considering how often you see them in RPGs.  Don't get me wrong, I like romances, it's just nice to have an RPG where you don't have to automatically assume that the first female character in the party is going to be a stereotypical love interest.  It's rather refreshing.Battle System (score 9/10): You know what I like about this battle system?  After playing a slew of newer RPGs, it just feels nice to play one with a good solid turn-based battle system with no gimmicks and no crap.  Every mechanic works and feels simple and easy to understand while still having enough complexity to it to keep the player interested.  First off you have the simple menu options an RPG player would expect such as Attack, Guard, Skills, Item, etc.  It's not all completely standard, though, as there is a also a nice grid system in place.  Basically, you can use skills (which consume MP) to move enemies around the grid and shove them together for nice combo attacks.  Chaining together combo attacks is an important part of gameplay and a fun battle mechanic in general.  I'd also like to mention the difficulty progression feels smooth and gradual (well, except for this one point near Ch. 4 when you're fighting for Celestia and I suddenly had to grind quite a bit, but after that, a huge difficulty spike never happened again), and I never felt like the game was overly difficult or required an intense amount of grinding.  Overall, Radiant Historia has a good solid battle system, and I'm thoroughly pleased with it!Gameplay (score 9/10): This is a bit of a catch-all category for me.  Well, what can I say here?  The menus all work, and the pacing of the game is good.  I really like the fact that you can play this game entirely with the stylus OR entirely with the buttons (I prefer not using the stylus for turn-based RPGs as it can get tiring on the hand).  I also appreciate the game having a detailed outline of events that happen in both timelines so you don't get the story confused, and it also records sidequest events.  I don't really have much to complain about.  In fact, remember that time traveling mechanic I mentioned in the story section?  The levels your characters get in one timeline carries over to the other!  That's awesome!  I also love the fact that you can skip cutscenes by just pressing the Start button (which is essential if you time travel back to a point that has a ton of cutscenes you've already viewed).  If I had one complaint though, I'd have to complain that there aren't enough \"active nodes\" you can return to.  Active nodes are the points in history which you can time travel back to; if you leave one timeline to go to another, you could lose some of your progress from events past the most recent node and have to go through certain events again.  I'd like to say that's my only complaint, but I can think of one more little irritant: every time you time travel or even sometimes after a scene, the game switches out your party members, even if you have access to the members that you had already selected!  It's annoying to have to keep remembering to switch my party members back!  Other than those two things, though, I don't have any other complaints.Overall (score 9/10): NOTE this score is not an average; it's my subjective overall score.  I thoroughly enjoyed this game.  It has all the charm of an older classic RPG but with the smooth gameplay conveniences of a modern RPG.  It doesn't get much better than that!  I daresay Radiant Historia is proof positive that an RPG doesn't need the flashiest graphics around nor does it doesn't to be an \"action game\" to still be awesome.  So if you are a fan of traditional RPGs and are looking for a good satisfying RPG to enjoy, try picking up Radiant Historia.  It's well worth the money!\n",

      "Final Fantasy XIII-2 is the sequel to the controversial 2010 release Final Fantasy XIII. It is loved by many, and hated by others. This is something that it has in common with many of the predecessors that came before it. Square-Enix was determined to try and fix many of the mistakes they felt that they had made.Personally I have enjoyed every Final Fantasy, even Final Fantasy XI, XII, XIII, and XIV (now). I come into each, and every one of them with a different set of eyes. This is not a series that is not going to stay along a specific formula. Each chapter in the Final Fantasy saga is constantly evolving, and changing. It is up to the fans to embrace that change or sadly this Fantasy may be Final for you.Story (Spoiler free):The story in XIII-2 is pretty interesting. It plays off similarly to a mystery. It starts off 3 years after the events of the previous game. Lightning is gone, and Serah is determined to find her along with Noel. They set off on their grand adventure. Where did Lightning go? How is Noel involved? Who is Etro, and how is she involved? What is the main goal of the antagonist? All of these questions popped into my mind several times. Luckily XIII-2 succeeds in the story department, especially in the later segments of the game. XIII-2 has an excellent cast of characters, with one of the best antagonists in recent memory.If you aren't a fan of getting the overall plot in smaller portions, and then a grand finale in the later segments of the game. You will more than likely dislike XIII-2s story. Also one needs to remember that this is a time travel game so you need to keep an open mind of what is happening because there are certain things that don't make sense at first, but they will later on. Outside of the story from the cinematics, some bits and pieces are told through data logs and through NPCs (Talk to ALL of them). This was a nice addition because I really enjoyed reading those extra tidbits from the datalog fragments.Gameplay:Final Fantasy XIII-2 is a time traveling game. You will be delving through the Historia Crux jumping between the timelines to enter new areas. In these areas you can of course do the main plot, but Square also implemented many outside additions for the players to do. These biggest additions include:Monster Hunting - One of the best additions to the game. The 3rd slot in the party belongs to a monster, so hunting is essential. You can capture tonberrys, cactaurs, ochus, and even in some cases primals! Each monster has a different role, and can be leveled through the Crystarium (similarly to the main characters, except they take monster components). In certain cases, there are even one of kind monsters. So choose wisely before you level them up. Monsters can be infused to inherit abilities, and traits. One can lose hours of their lives with this system, especially if you want to catch them all.Sidequests - There are tons of these throughout the game. There are simple fetch quests, killing quests, detailing a map, obtaining 100% of the beastiary, solving puzzles, answering questions, and many more. The nice addition that Square did here is that every character in the game has a voice over, and they aren't reused. If Square did re-use voice actors for NPCs they did a darn good job of hiding it, and I'm pretty good at catching that sort of thing. Also every quest is started in the form of a basic cut-scene. Gone are the days of long dreadful text walls.Paradox Puzzles - Square implemented puzzles to the game in the form of Paradox Puzzles. These puzzles take place in what seems like a rift between time, and there are three different forms of puzzles. Running tile puzzles, connect the dots of sorts, and the brain crunching clock puzzles. Some of these puzzles had me stumped. One in particular took me close to an hour to figure out. (By the way, those clock puzzles are random. Good luck finding a guide).Serendipity - This optional area is a theme park of sorts if you wish to call it that. There is Chocobo Racing, Slot machines, and more that will be added later via DLC such as card games. There are dozens of adornments to be found, tons of prizes to win, and lots of money to be lost.The battle system is pretty much the same as Final Fantasy XIII. At first I actually had a hard time readjusting to it because it's so darn fast. I still dislike the \"Auto-Battle\" option but I do understand why it's there. You never have to use it once through the entire game if you wish not too.Square redid a lot of the animations, especially in the magic department. The later tier magic spells seemed to have a lot more effects than its predecessor which I found to be really nice. Though there was a lot of reuse in abilities such as \"Ruin, Blitz, Imperil\" and more. Monsters from XIII are also reused in a lot of areas, which is also understandable because it's still the same world so they aren't going to just disappear. However if in the future a sequel is made (oh and there will be) I would like to see more additions. There is enough for it not too be annoying, but I would like to see more variations.Characters advance through the Crystarium, a system used in Final Fantasy XIII. While it may look similar in style to its counterpart it's actually a lot different. There is still a one way path for each role, but depending on what role you level and when, the stats you have at the end of the Crystarium may differ greatly from another player. When leveling the \"Bigger Orbs\" there are stat bonuses determined by that role. For example a Commando is a 2 STR bonus, while a Ravager is 2 MAG bonus. Choose wisely.Square implemented dialogue trees, and cinematic actions for more of a western appeal approach. These additions were alright, but as a fan of JRPGs over WRPGs. I hope that in the future, they stay far away from the genre. It's not that I dislike them, but I would rather appreciate 100% of the story, and watch the impressive cutscenes.Music:The music in Final Fantasy XIII-2 is a bit of a departure from other games in the series. A good portion of the soundtrack which boasts over 70 songs has vocals. Luckily the rap tracks have been eliminated from the western version, but almost all of the songs are a delight to listen too. Naoshi Mizuta, Masashi Hamauzu, Nobuo Uematsu, and Mitsuto Suzuki put together a very decent soundtrack.There were only a few songs I really disliked, and unsurprisingly they were composed by Nobuo. I am a big fan of Nobuo's early work but that Crazy Chocobo theme was entirely unnecessary, and didn't fit with the Final Fantasy universe at all. Head banging, and really crazy death metal isn't my style especially in a boss fight or, when riding a cute little bird.Naoshi Mizuta continues to impress me with themes like \"Warrior Goddess\" and \"Caius Theme.\" I really hope that he is a part of all future Final Fantasy installments. In my opinion he is the new Nobuo Uematsu of this time period.Technical Problems:In a generation where video game technical issues seem to be the norm, it is nice that Square-Enix is ahead of the curve with their single player Final Fantasy games. However the game is not perfect. There are frame drops in cut scenes. They aren't anything that will significantly irritate the player (and most people probably will not notice it at all) but it does break my focus.Thankfully though out of the entire time I spent with the game that was all I encountered. No freezes, no screen tears, no cutting out music, hell my entire 24MB save didn't drop to 10 frames at all!What I played:My adventure in XIII-2 lasted about 65 hours (the main story took me roughly 35 hours, and I skipped some content). That time will differ heavily depending on what content you do. The Platinum trophy has been obtained, and I have conquered a majority of the games content. I have seen every Paradox ending, the secret ending, and all 160 fragments have been found. I however did not capture every monster (but I did kill them all ^^), or obtain all of the adornments that can be found throughout the game. I also did not collect the weapons that require ridiculous farming time.My score and final thoughts:Final Fantasy XIII-2 is by no means a perfect game, because it isn't. Not everyone will enjoy XIII-2 but I do believe that Square succeeded in bringing back the joy for many Final Fantasy Fans. XIII-2 boasts a very decent story, great music, decent characters, one hell of a protagonist, and one of the most memorable endings I have ever seen. Time literally flew by while playing XIII-2 for me, so thanks Square for the fun.Quick Recap:Pros:CharactersStoryMusicCaius is EPICMonster HuntingEndingIllusion of freedom is backCollector's Edition has an amazing casingNeutral:Dialogue TreesCinematic ActionsRe-use of Monster assetsCons:Inconsistent Difficulty (Luckily the Final Boss is insanely fun!)Frame drops in cut scenesNobuo's ridiculous head banging musicNote: This review has also been posted on the standard edition, because I purchased them both.

      "The great thing about this game are the options available. Player creation, coaches, outfits are all very good. But, I have to admit like the others have said, the game takes a long time to load. First, you have to load to get to the menu. That takes a while. Then, you have to load career. That takes longer. Then, you you have to load the tournament....which also takes a long time. Aah, finally...that is what you wanted to hear me say, isn't it? No....it is still not over yet. You now have to load the match!I have a very fast PC with a damn good graphics accelerator. Still, it takes such a long time to load.There are graphic glitches as well. Sometimes, everything goes in slow motion or the screen freezes. It happens occasionally. And from what I know about tennis, ball boys are supposed to pick up the ball when it hits the net, which they don't. They just run leaving the ball where it is. It looks silly when they do that. One other reviewer mentioned that having the Number 1 and Number 2 player in the same draw is an inexcusable error. Boy, was that an understatement? I guess he was being nice. Almost all the top players are put in one draw and the rest are put in the other. This is a mockery of tennis.Other major goof ups: The whole attitude stuff after each point is silly and extremely irritating to say the least. Watch some professional tennis matches and tell me which player does those stupid attitude things. This is not a popularity contest. This is tennis. No player I remember ever does the things they show in this game, unless they are big time jerks.There are no replays, which is not realistic. And as far as I can remember, I have never seen anyone playing tennis with pants in grand slam events. It looks pathetic. This is the 21st century. Not early 1900s. The entire rival player idea is pathetic. The player's rival loses in the first round of every tournament, yet keeps rising up in the rankings rapidly. That is plainly impossible. And the stupid e-mails the rivals send make these players look like a bunch of 12-year-olds getting at each other. There was no need for a rival scenario in the game. It just makes the game look ridiculously stupid. And in the real world, a player's major rival is almost always from a different country. Federer-Nadal, Edberg-Becker, Graf-Seles...so on. Sampras-Agassi was one major exception.But, the bottom line, is it fun to play? It is if you can ignore the comments from your rival. Less than $10 for this game is a reasonable price, which is what is charged here. But, the errors should make you think twice about buying this game for a higher price. Tennis is definitely better, however, on many levels. Tennis Masters Series by Microids could have easily beaten this game as being the best out there. But what was lacking there were a lot options available in Top Spin.I have no idea how Top Spin 3 fares in comparison. But, I can tell you that the makers of that game decided to isolate the PC gamers. But, I cannot blame 2K for that entirely. This trend has been going on for a while. EA, 2K, and several gaming organizations are slowly doing away with the manufacture of PC games. That means the gaming users need to adapt and get the consoles. In other words, unfortunately, what medium we choose to entertain ourselves is governed by powerful organizations, and this is no different in the gaming industry; so, we need to change.\n",

      "EA Sports certainly put all their attention to this years hockey games to the Playstation2.  Their NHL 2001 for the Psx1 was terrible and nothing new when compared to last years title.  However, on the Psx2, things are much different and the disapointment level is much less.To start with, this game looks amazing.  Everything from the animation of real-looking checks, facial expressions, player complaints (when called for penalties), injuries (players grab their hips for hip injuries and wrists for wrist injuries), realistic deflections, goals scoring by screening goalies (put a guy in front of the opponents goalie and watch the late reaction by the netminder), all the way to the coach yelling at the ref and other players on the bench interacting with the game is simply amazing.  Some other great things in this game are the best features ever.  Take all the gameplay options to creat bigger checks, more rebounds, etc.  My favorite option is with the game clock.  All games are 20 minutes (FINALLY!!!), but you can adjust the clock speed (not length) to make periods go to actually 20 minutes or speed the clock to go 10 or 5 minutes (this is really a good thing because I hate losing my power-forward for the whole period for fighting if I play a 5 minute game).  Back in the game is the ref kicking out centers from the faceoffs who's controlled by a button-mashing player.  Stat tracking, injuries, and suspensions are done perfectly.  Gameplay is right on, too.  Gone is the sloppy control and game physics and the AI on the All-Star level is dead-on to real life teams and players--I'm currently playing a season with the Rangers on the All-Star lever and I currently have a 20-21-6-1 record with my top scorer having around 46 points (no more unrealistic stats).The bad in this game is limited.  The main thing I can't stand is the ultra-poor goalies.  Far too many weak goals are scored.  The only way to eliminate this is to learn how to control your goalie manually, or be frustrated on a regular basis when your goalie weakly waves at a super-slow wrister from the point and totally misses it.  If you can learn to play as your goalie when on defense, you'll eliminate this problem.  The other main problem with the game isn't as big as the goalie problem, but improvements can be done to make the fighting better.  The fighting looks great, but still, players just stand there and take a beating (the fighting in this game is very similiar to the fighting in the original arcade &quot;Blades of Steel&quot; that came out around 1990).Overall (graphically, sound, options, and overall gameplay), this game is the best hockey game I've played in a long time--if not the best ever!!!  Tweak the gameplay options to your liking and from the pre-game introduction to the three-stars of the game, you'll find out that this is the best hockey game this year!!!  I'm not just saying this because it's on the Psx2--I'm saying this because it's been a while since I've really enjoyed a hockey sim on ANY platform.\n",

      "Let me start off by saying that I can understand some of the negative views on this game.  Sure, it looks and sounds like NHL 06, but if it weren't for the odd control scheme, one would think it was a tad like NHL 2004.  Where this isn't a huge upgrade to last years game, it is better.By no means am I saying that it's an NHL 2004 clone--that it's not.  However, like NHL 2004, the defenses swallow-up the puck carriers and clog the neutral zone.  There is just not as much room to skate this year (like NHL 2004) as compared to last years game.  So, you can't skate end-to-end with any player on your team--you need to pass and dump the puck, too.  The goalies are much better than last year (sometimes) as they don't flop all over the ice like they did in NHL 06.  Goalies can, though, still overplay the puck at times.  Goalies also tend to not know how to play their angles properly and, even if they see the shot completely, they react late on many shots resulting in some rather soft goals far too often--they can stop an elite player on a breakaway, but then allow some no-namer score on them with a floater from a bad angle.EA Sports changed the controls to where nothing you do is like past releases.  However, you can change and adjust the control settings to your liking.  Other settings include the usual on how much defense, blocked shots, shot power, shot accuracy, etc.  Turn down (all the way) the intensity, shot power, shot accuracy, hitting power, game speed, passing speeds--offense sliders; turn up the shot blocking, pass blocking, poke checking--defensive sliders; and you get a very realistic game.  Shots and passes actually do get blocked and go wide (especially backhanded one-timers), more realistic stats, etc.Note:  EA toned down the one-timers quite a bit.  If your player doesn't have good shot accuracy, most of his one-timers and slapshots will go wide of the net.On a bad note:  Along with the soft goals that go in far too often, there are also some bad checking animations.  Far too many high sticking and elbowing penalties are called (and the replays confirm the infractions with precision).  Another bad thing is game's music.  EA Sports has never really had great song and band selection, and this years hockey release is no different.  With the exception of maybe a few choice-cuts, the music is very bad (but it can be turned off).  The play-by-play/color commentary is identical as last seasons game--it's still Jim Hugheson and Craig Simpson (Not Gary Thorne and Bill Clement like on the Xbox360 version).  Another bad thing is the rosters.  Superstars are on their new teams (mostly), but the average players are on their old teams retro to before last seasons NHL trading dead line.  Lucky for us, though, you can take your Psx2 and NHL 07 online and download roster updates (which includes more recent trades, free agent signings, and new players).The game may look and sound like last years title, but it plays like NHL 06 with some NHL 2004 mixed in (meaning in terms of defense).  I was skeptical on purchasing this title because of all the bad reviews, but I can honestly say that those reviews are not entirely accurate.  I can see where some will be upset with a few things--such as the figure skating game play with players doing triple-axles everywhere.  However, many (not all, though) of the small things can easily fixed by adjusting the gameplay settings (sliders), learn how to play defense (stay in position, block shots, and get in passing lanes to help compensate for the inconsistant goalies), and most importantly--play the game like you see in on TV or at the rink.  There are some things like the figure skating and horrible goalies which you simply can't control--and that kills the game play.This game isn't perfect, but it's not as bad as others make it to be.  The huge upgraded gameplay went to the next-gen system releases, but EA Sports did make a better hockey experience from last season.  Those things that made NHL 06 not too realistic are pretty much fixed this year.  I'm a die-hard hockey fan and a die-hard hockey gamer--I look for realistic/sim type games.  NHL 07 has some of a sim feel, but there are some things you simply cannot control--and that's not a true sim.  EA Sports NHL series hasen't been perfect.  However, with this years release, it's slowly getting there.  I just wish the goalies weren't so inconsistant and the figure skating was kept to the Olympics.  If you eliminate these two serious problems, then this game would be nearly perfect.\n",

      "Yep folks it's NBA time again. And with the new season comes the three new games all of us basketball junkies anticipate. So the race for the best basketball game is on! My winner is: NBA 2K7. Instead of focusing on create-a-shoe and dunk contests, 2K games have focused on the most up-to-date graphics and the most realistic gameplay a basketball game could possibly offer.With that said, I would like to say the game didn't automatically appeal to me at first. Alot of people are complaining that it is the exact same game as 2K6, but I don't see how 2K games could've improved very much over that game. 2K6 was an amazing game. And to be perfectly honest, I don't think that 2K7 is on it's level entirely. First things first, let me tell you about the gameplay. Some of the crossover moves and spins and dribbles are sloppier than the previous addition. And the control you have over your player was a bit minimized in this game. But other than those two annoyances, the game is really easy to get into and by far the best basketball game this year.Of course, you have the Association, where you take a team and try to become a dynasty over a long period of time. All of the same aspects are back, such as the Owner's Mood, Team Chemistry, Practices, and Development. There is a new addition to the trading part though, as you can now have three teams involved in one trade. There is also a section for award races, where you can see the top 5 runners for the end of the year awards. That's pretty cool as well.  Everything else about this is pretty much the same as the previous year's game. For reasons that I do not know, 2K games took out the 24/7 mode for the Playstation 2 and I think it is only on the 360 version of the game. It may affect some people, but seeing as that particular mode wasn't my main conern, it's absence doesn't really bother me. There's street games as well, where you can even play with celebrities by the likes of Common, ?uestlove, Aceyalone, and others. You can even play in the weirdest places (one of your choices is Egypt).You still have your Crib and your VIP. Everything in the crib is pretty much the same, where you can put up pennants, bobbleheads, framed jerseys, etc. and play mini-games like air hockey and darts. Your VIP is pretty much the same as well, where you can save your stats and check your tendencies at any time. Your off-the-dribble moves were changed a bit this time around. You can perform different moves by selecting different buttons, instead of some random crossover or spin. You still use the left analong stick to control it though.What I like most about this game though are the styles they've added to individual players. Even though 2K games have always been pretty good about creating simulated replicas of NBA players, they've gotten even better this year. If anyone is familiar with Shawn Marion, they'd know his shot is rather weird. Well, on the game, Shawn Marion will shoot just like he does in real life. And if you're familiar with the Suns' style of play, you'd know they pass rather quickly to get a quick easy bucket, and that's exactly what they do on the game as well. That's how I can say it's probably the most realistic game in the history of NBA games. However, there's one thing that really bothers me about the gameplay. When your opponent comes up to shoot close to the basket, and you foul him, he almost ALWAYS makes it. He'll make the shot for the 3-point play about 95% of the time. That's about the only unrealistic part in this game.So, if you want the best basketball game to buy, you better buy this one. It doesn't get much realer than this. It's cheaper than Live, it's more realistic, and it's an overall better game. Any NBA junkie needs this game. It's your best choice if you want the realest simulated basketball game ever invented.\n",

      "ESPN NHL Hockey 2004 is the sequel to the best hockey game ever, Sega's NHL 2k3. You've probably read all of the mixed reviews on message boards, but a lot of the problem was that last year's game was so amazing and different, that the expectations for this game were way out of reach. This game still delivers authentic hockey action. What makes it worth the price for upgrading over last year is all of the new features.-Historic teams. The only problem is that they cant use the names or the numbers, so you have to go and edit them. You can relive the 1994 Finals with the '94 Canucks and Rangers...I can be my 1992 Chicago Blackhawks and erase the sweep that the Penguins put on us that season in the finals!-Skills Challenge. You get to do all of the events from &quot;All-Star Saturday&quot; including Hardest Shot, fastest skater, accuracy shooting, breakaway relay, puck control, etc.-Mini-games. You can play 2-on-2 in a small, outdoor rink. You can also do a shootout!-Awesome franchise mode. You can actually use created players in your franchise this year (That option was left out last year). You also have a GM office, and you get &quot;email&quot; when something happens around th league.-TONS, and I mean TONS of jerseys. This is just cool...every team has A LOT (most teams have ALL) of the jerseys that a particular franchise has ever worn. This game also has the new Coyotes jersey..These are just a few of the reasons to buy EPN NHL Hockey. If you want arcadey, high scoring hockey, you should probably look elsewhere...if you want authentic hockey, such as actually setting up special teams, defenses, and goalies who will make you work for goals, just click the &quot;order now&quot; button on this page...you wont be dissapointed!\n",

      "THE SHORT: Less gory and satanic than the first game, but with a great story- the most coherent and understandable in the series, and with a fantastic twist at the end. 5 possible endings, great atmosphere. Sometimes frustrating (but adjustable) puzzle difficulty but fairly easy fighting.THE LONG: The original game was great- similar to Resident Evil but unique enough to stand on its own, the game was dark, disturbing and satanic. The problem was, the storyline was so ambitious that it got pretty sloppy and weird at the end, with some plot details (such as a drug cult) not as fleshed out as it should have been. This game fixes things by concentrating on the main character, whose journey to the same town of Silent Hill is brought on by a letter that he received from his wife. Though dead from a fatal illness, her very writing asks James to return to the town, the site of some bittersweet memories for them.As James travels through town, he meets some strange people who all seem to be off in some way. One is remarkably passive/ aggressive, one is suicidal, one is a little girl who seems to know him, and one of them is a woman who looks just like his dead wife, which brings out some conflicting emotions in James. These characters come and go as the game goes on, and they occasionally do some odd things. But the beauty of the story is that, when all is said and done, the motivation for these characters makes absolute sense- once you realize what they mean to James and why they're in Silent Hill in the first place. Whereas the first game unravels with a lot of obscure mythological references to religious artifacts and demonic possession, this one is strengthened completely at its conclusion, a conclusion that makes us rethink the motives and actions of every character in the game.This is true of the game's biggest, most dynamic character- Pyramid Head. An apparent humanoid with a strange, triangular shape of flesh or metal on (or in place of) its head, this character represents sheer malice to James. From the moment he discovers it in an abandoned apartment building to the time he discovers hints of its origins, Pyramid Head is one of, if not the most, creepy of the series' foes. He isn't all over you in the game but instead appears occasionally from the shadows, often when you least expect him, slowly but steadily approaching James as he tries to flee. And once you learn what little you can of him near the end, it adds to the finale more than any of the other characters. Pyramid Head has a purpose, and once it's revealed what that purpose is, that great ending starts to form and you realize how psychologically powerful this game is.All this story would be moot if there wasn't a good presentation, which there definitely is. Like the original game, your character wanders around a misty, fog-enshrouded abandoned town where nothing feels right and glimpses of things skittering about are caught. The game starts slowly, intentionally- don't get too impatient when first running through the woods and into town, it's meant to be suspenseful and build the mood. And by the time you're an hour or so into the game, what a mood it is. This game contains what's surely one of the most unsettling locations in the series- at one important juncture you enter the town's historical society and descend several hundred feet into ground, only to find a morgue, bloody pits that go farther and farther down, and Silent Hill's long abandoned underground prison. This location alone sets some great mood, as you see scrawls of long-dead prisoners and hear things from unseen places (listen for the heavy footsteps of something that seems to be whispering \"Hurt you\").The mood is also heightened by little glimpses of the town that you find. You read about a grisly child killing and hear about a mysterious shipwreck, and learn the fascinating story of why a swamp got its bloody name. Like the first game, things are never quite right- but once \"the darkness\" falls, things get more twisted and you're in a nightmare world. And this world seems tailor made to oppress James.This is the first in the series to allow both free roaming controls as well as the remote-control car style used in the original game, and other things, such as the boxes of bullets and first aid kits, will be familiar to players of the first game. As will the radio that emits louder and louder white noise as you approach, and the trusty flashlight (which you'll definitely be using). So it's the same gameplay to those familiar with the series and other games like it. Puzzle difficulty is actually adjustable and quite easy on the simplest level, so this game won't have you running for a strategy guide. Unfortunately, combat is also somwehat simple. There are some neat boss fights but the rest of the game is more about exploring, not fighting (though there's a lot to fight should you choose). But this lean on exploration is appreciated since this game gives you the biggest glimpse into what Silent Hill is really like.Lastly, there's the basic version of this game and then the updated one for several systems that contains a few new options as well as a new mini-quest revolving around the character of Maria. This is the one to get, as price-wise they're about the same, but don't expect much- the new quest is less than an hour long though it does add some interesting perspective to the game.Long story short, it's the same Silent Hill that you may have liked in part one, and before things got increasingly less Silent Hill-ish with the next couple games. So play this game for the most definitive, moody Silent Hill in the series, and for the best, most understandable story as well- one of the best and most mature game stories in general. After all, Roger Avery, Oscar winning co-writer of Pulp Fiction, is doing the Silent Hill movie- and this one's his favorite too.\n",

      "The Silent Hill series has been around for years, and despite being a fan of supernatural/horror games, I never got around to picking it up, after hearing that it was more focused on the psychological horror aspect, rather then normal, \"I'm going to tear your face off\" horror aspect.  Yet, after seeing the film adaptation of the series, I decided to dive in and try out the Silent Hill series, and \"Homecoming\" was my first visit to the infamous town.\"Homecoming\" follows Alex Shepard, a young soldier heading home to be back with his family after a stay in a rather unsettling hospital.  But once he arrives home, Alex finds that his hometown is now shrouded in fog, the town's residents are all but missing, his brother is missing, and oh yeah, demonic beasties roam the streets.  Now Alex has to not only find his brother, but also discover exactly what's going on, and if he can stop it.Despite my initial hesitation about heavy psychological angst, \"Homecoming\" quickly drew me in with plenty of monsters to fight, lots of fog, dark caverns, and dilapidated buildings, which creates an excellent atmosphere that's a lot of fun to go through.  And to add icing to the atmosphere cake, \"Homecoming\" features a story that was genuinely interesting and kept my interest all the way through, including moments where you have to make some really personal choices that affect which of the five endings you'll get.  Fans of the film will be pleased to see a few elements make their way in, such as the nasty little bugs, the real time transitions between the real world and the bloody otherworld, and Pyramid Head himself; he doesn't show up often, but when he does, he easily steals the show.However, while \"Homecoming\" may offer a great atmosphere and compelling story, it falls short in the combat department.  While \"Homecoming\" makes it a large selling point, citing Alex's military experience, the combat system relies on precise timing of attacks, rather then just bashing away at enemies with whatever weapon you have on hand (Ironically, the knife based weapons are the best, as you can attack very quickly, making it difficult for enemies to attack you back).  While you do have a dodge button that you MUST master if you want to beat the game, it only works about half the time, and because of that, you'll die a lot...every time I died while playing \"Homecoming,\" I felt like the game had been cheating on me, which made things frustrating very quickly, especially with those damn nurses.Aside from the combat, there are a few other annoyances:  While Alex's brother, Josh, is a huge part of the story, he embraces the horror cliche of running away from you whenever you come across him, to the point where by the end, I wanted to shoot him in the legs just so the brat would stop running from me.  There's also a sewer stage that, despite the potential for a really creepy underground atmosphere, ends up being arguably the most tedious and boring sewer level I've ever played in a game, and I was very glad to see it end.Still, despite the frustrating combat and a few little annoyances, \"Homecoming\" does offer a great atmosphere and a genuinely compelling story, along with some really memorable choices that you have to make (and a gripping quicktime sequence in the third act that I won't spoil).  Overall, \"Homecoming\" is an average game that's definitely worth checking out at least once for fans of the franchise, and newcomers like me will find it enjoyable, but a little frustrating along the way.\n",

      "unlike so many other people, i've never played a tomb raider game before.  i think that puts me in a position to offer an unbiased opinion without any baggage or preconceived notions about what a new tomb raider game *should* be.  so, if you're new to the franchise, hopefully my thoughts will helpful to you.and here's what i think: this game is a whole lot of fun.  the folks at crystal dynamics have taken a page or two from the Uncharted playbook in this origin story and  if imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, the folks at naughty dog ought to be patting themselves on the back (yes, i know TR pre-dates uncharted by more than a decade).  but rest assured that this is by no means an 'uncharted' knock off.  in fact, i like this game much more than i liked UC3.lara croft isn't quite as dynamic as nathan drake, but that's a good thing.  the lara croft of this latest iteration of TR is a more somber heroine, a little more world-weary, a little more wise-beyond-her-ears.  camilla luddington is great as the titular character.  she excels at grounding lara croft in the real world, avoiding unnecessary histrionics and over-the-top moments you see in so many video game characters.  she's a tough-as-nails character, and not a caricature, and right from the get go you know who lara croft is and she stays true to it throughout.the world of TR is a rich and colorful and ripe for exploration.  it's not quite an open world game, but it's pretty close.  within each arena you're given plenty of room to roam about and find the innumerable collectibles.  each accomplishment gives you XP which you can use to upgrade Lara's skill and equipment.  another nice touch is to add specific challenges to each level (a la 'hitman'), giving you plenty of replay value once you finish the game (you can fast travel to locations you've previously discovered instead of having to restart a chapter or level).the only real gripe i have with this game is the use of quick time events.  it's 2013, developers.  you don't have to give us button-mashing moments.  they're tired and tedious and a few times i just wanted to quit the game because of them (or at very least take a break).  but that's only one quibble in a game that satisfies on so many levels.  I've not tried the multiplayer, nor do i intend to, but from everything I've read there's nothing there you've haven't done one hundred times before.in short, i had a lot of fun with this game and would wholeheartedly recommend it.  and maybe someday we'll get a lara croft/nathan drake game.  wouldn't that be something?\n",

      "Tomb Raider has been rebooted, as many franchises are doing now, and the result is an enjoyable if not wholly original experience.In this new Tomb Raider, you play as a young Lara Croft, off on her first expedition. Unfortunately for her and her crew, things go horribly wrong as their ship is destroyed by an unnatural storm and they are stranded on a mysterious island inhabited by psychotic cultists. Lara soon learns that it's kill or be killed, and she must take on the roll of hero to save her friends and escape the island. The set up is exciting, and the presentation throughout the game enforces the sense of peril and dread that such a scenario would embody.The beginning of the game is a tutorial of sorts, but there are quite a few QTEs (Quick Time Events) that require timed button presses while watching a cut scene. Many gamers argue that QTEs are not gameplay, and never has that been more apparent than in Tomb Raider. I got sick of the QTEs quick and hoped they would go away soon. Thankfully, after the first hour of the game, the QTEs disappear and don't rear their ugly head again. But if they aren't part of the gameplay mechanics, why are they there in the first place? The game would have benefited from their omission.Once the game opens up, the gameplay is a cross between Batman: Arkham City and Uncharted 3. A lot of the levels are very linear, which like Uncharted, keeps the game tight and focused. You'll jump across a chasm, swing across a poll, grab the side of a cliff, shimmy across to a plank, vault up, then balance-beam walk across it to your destination. The levels are designed so that at first glance everything looks natural, but as you make your way to your destination you'll see the chipped white paint of a climbable ledge, or secured rope to zip-line across. The game gives subtle visual clues that you'll grow to recognize and will aid you in traversing the island. If you've played Uncharted, you know what I'm talking about.The controls are tight and responsive. Lara moves naturally and I rarely had an issue with getting Lara where I wanted her to go. Climbing ledges and scaling rocks felt right. It was fast enough to keep me from feeling bored, but not so fast that Lara felt like a toy. Lara has a sense of weight to her, and the animation and controls make her feel like she's really in the environment. When compared with previous Tomb Raider games, the controls are a welcome improvement.The game also has lots of gunplay. The combat controls feel very similar to Uncharted. You pull the left trigger to aim and the right trigger to shoot, and you can even click the right thumbstick to zoom in a little. Like previous Tomb Raider games, the auto-aim is very strong, which is a blessing and a curse. In one on one combat, it is very easy to quickly pull the left trigger, then immediately pull the right trigger for a very fast kill. But when you're up against 5 or more enemies (as frequently happens later in the game), the auto-aim locks on to the nearest enemy, not who you're pointing at. Several times, I was trying to kill a sniper, but when I pulled the left trigger to aim at him, the auto-aim would pull the camera away from where I was pointing and aim at a guy down below him, because he was slightly closer, even though the sniper posed a more immediate threat. There are also plenty of explosive red barrels (a cliche every shooter game has), but again when I'd point the camera at a barrel, the auto-aim would pull the camera away from it and lock onto the nearest enemy, forcing me to pull the camera back over to the barrel to shoot it. As far as I could tell, there is no option to turn auto-aim off, so whatever help it provides in aiming is negated by the frustration of aiming at the wrong thing. This really only became an issue later in the game at the battles became bigger, but it would have been nice to have the option to turn it off. Also, the auto-aim oddly points at the enemy's bellybutton, making headshots a chore.Like many of today's third person shooters, Lara can take cover behind walls and shoot from cover. Lara takes cover automatically, and it works surprisingly well. 99% of the time the game knows what you're trying to do, but there were a few rare moments where I was hiding on one side of a wall and started getting shot by an enemy I didn't see, so I'd try to walk around to the other side of the wall to take cover, but Lara would just get stuck on the corner and die. This was a rare occurrence, but frustrating nonetheless.When not killing and preforming acrobatics, Lara will solve puzzles. The Tomb Raider series is known for some real head-scratchers, so I was a little disappointed that all of the puzzles in the new Tomb Raider are trivial at best. I never spent more than 2 minutes on a puzzle room, and I'm not exactly a big puzzle guy. I can't imagine anyone who uses even the littlest bit of thought having any issues getting past these. Even the optional tombs in the game have easy puzzles. At the very least, the optional tomb puzzles should have provided the challenge gamers are used to solving in the Tomb Raider series.Taking a page from Batman: Arkham City, Lara will find new weapons and gadgets that will aid her on her adventure. One such item is a bow and arrow that can be fitted with a rope, which Lara can use to climb across chasms or pull down barriers, like Batman's grappling hook. Lara can also use \"Survival Instinct\" with the push of a button, which functions in the same way as Batman's \"Detective Mode\". This will highlight enemies, interactive objects, and your destination. As you find treasure and defeat enemies, Lara will gain experience which will culminate in Skill Points that Lara can spend to learn new skills and moves, like Batman. Through some sections of the game, Lara can sneak around, and if unnoticed, can stealthily dispatch enemies, like Batman. I guess someone on the development team was a Batman fan.The story in Tomb Raider starts out strong, but unfolds in a very straightforward manner until the end. There are some pretty interesting moments in the game, but large explosions do not equate interesting story. Lara herself feels well rounded (no pun intended), but the rest of the cast are painfully one dimensional. Even the villain, who doesn't show up till half-way through the game, doesn't reveal his motivation until near the end, and when you hear it, it's just kind of like, \"Oh, well that's silly.\" There's a sort-of-twist near the end that is foreshadowed so much that it comes as no surprise when it happens, no to mention it's a cliche that many games have used before. If the same level of thought had been applied to the other characters and plot that they gave to Lara, it would be outstanding. As it is, the story is serviceable, but nothing noteworthy.The graphics are a real sight to behold, and are by far the best aspect of the game. There were many times in the game where I would just stop and look at a set piece because it looked so gorgeous. The \"Wow\" factor plays a part in the atmosphere of the game, and the outstanding visuals make those moments genuine. The character models are detailed and their animation is very realistic. The performances of the actors, both the motion capture and their voice performance, are well done. The villain comes across as cartoony, but maybe that was deliberate? Like Uncharted, Tomb Raider is trying to feel like a big summer blockbuster movie. The cinematic camera angles, grand scope, gigantic sets, and constant danger all accomplish this well. There are some scenes in the game where a bridge is crumbling beneath Lara as she runs for her life or a building is burning all around her as she desperately fights for survival. These moments are genuinely thrilling, and the graphics and animation are a big part of that. I recently played Crysis 3 and was amazed at the level of visual fidelity Crytek was able to accomplish on the aging Xbox 360 hardware. Tomb Raider is every bit as visually impressive as Crysis 3, which is really saying something.One thing that caught me off guard: Tomb Raider is a very mature game. In the past, Lara's adventures have been pretty PG-13, but this time around the language and gore are very graphic. There were parts where Lara is crawling through a tunnel filled with severed heads and limbs, or some corpses have their intestines lying next to their body. Also, adult language is thrown around frequently. It fits the atmosphere of the game, but was unexpected in the Tomb Raider franchise. Parents considering this for their kids will want to take this into consideration before purchasing.Tomb Raider is not a perfect game. I didn't like the QTEs, the auto-aim, the simple puzzles, or the half-baked story. But there is a lot more to like than not. The game is exciting, the gameplay is solid, and the presentation is outstanding. Tomb Raider borrows heavily from Batman: Arkham City and Uncharted 3, and although not original, the gameplay works well. Tomb Raider updates an aging franchise, but fails to innovate. The game is streamlined for a more focused experience, but as a result some of the challenge has been removed. Hardcore gamers looking for a real challenge may be disappointed, but everyone else should find something to like. If you're an Xbox gamer and have never played the Uncharted games, this is the closest you'll get to playing Uncharted on the Xbox.I would recommend that everybody play Tomb Raider at least once. Whether to rent it or buy it depends on how much money you have to spend, as the game is short enough to be completed in a weekend. There is multi-player, but I didn't bother with it, and from what I've heard it's not all that great. The single player campaign is a memorable experience and well worth your time.\n",

      "Bioshock games tend to be extremely ambitious both in storytelling and the choices one can make in the game; whether those choices involve the plot or the gameplay itself. Is Bioshock Infinite any good though? Especially compared to the excellent first Bioshock? The answer is a resounding yes. Let us detail the ways:Narrative: I've always considered the first Bioshock's story to be rather light other than the massive twist in the middle of the game, but Bioshock Infinite does not suffer from this. The main character Booker and the damsel-in-distress he must save are both fascinating characters. The ending is phenomenal and the game is worth playing just for that. The only downside to the story is the lack of clarity when it comes to the consequences of one's choices. And this paragraph is merely a light description of how grand the narrative really is.Gameplay: The gameplay in Bioshock Infinite is quite enjoyable. The gunplay is never too fast to disorient you and I found the guns easy to use and fun to experiment with. The only downside to the weaponry is that you can only carry two guns at one time. I missed Bioshock's weapon wheel and the ability to choose any of my guns at any time. The vigors are quite interesting (especially Murder of Crows and the Bucking Bronco) but I found that I used them rarely, if at all, and mostly just to supplement my lack of ammo for the guns. The most remarkable aspect of combat is your ally Elizabeth who supplies you with ammo and salts and can open up tears which can greatly aid one in combat. The sky lines are also a great way to open up combat as you can easily flank your opponents.Graphics: The city of Columbia is highly detailed and extravagant. While many could say the beginning is a bit slow, I found it exhilarating as one could explore Columbia and see all the interesting buildings that litter the landscape. While the graphics are not completely realistic, I found them quite amazing.Audio: The tv I own is not the greatest, so I am not going to properly judge the sound of Bioshock Infinite, but I do have a slight annoyance with it. I found it frustrating that I had to be looking at a person head on to hear anything they say, despite the fact that I could be standing shoulder to shoulder to them. That was a bit frustrating.All in all, Bioshock Infinite is a grand game. There are countless other things I could have gone more in depth about, but there is simply too much to cover. I will be honest, I beat the game in about nine hours which was perfect since I was pressed for time at that moment, but regardless there is plenty of replay value to be had with this game, an absolute must-buy.\n",

Pretty serious Yoga and Pilates can be practiced with this game, and in addition, you'll get guided meditation too, that you can choose from several different styles.

      "I love this game already.  It's like a workout DVD only better because you can choose your goals & what you want to work on.  For instance, I was in a hurry this morning so I just did the carribean vibe (low impact aerobics) for 9 min.  Obviously, I'll do more this afternoon. The virtual woman & scenery are just right for me (sort of reminds me of \"my fitness coach\" which I also love).  (There's also a virtual man trainer on here - so far I've seen him on the kickboxing segment - which is a challenge for me). You don't need your wii remote except for selecting exercises to work on.  I also clicked into options to make the encouraging comments during exercising less frequent & quieter than the instrumental music. I appreciate being able to adjust this. I'm on the honor system with this game (I did not get the camera version).  It's not going to grade your movements, which is fine with me.  I have plenty of those workout games that do that so this is a nice change. (I rotate my wii exercise games depending on my mood & I'm quite moody.  In this game, the six elements of fitness are: cardio, balance, upper body strength, lower body strength, core strength, & flexibility.  There are several goals to choose from, keeps track of your progress toward your goal. There's also challenge tests which I haven't done yet.\n",

      "I'll start off by saying I am a HUGE zumba fan. I have purchased all of the zumba dvd's and have now been working out with zumba for about 3 years. After mastering all of the zumba dvd's, I found out this game was going to be released and I purchased it along with the playstation eye, motion controller and the zumba belt. First, the game is a bit complicated to learn if you are completely new to the zumba world and have never used their dvds. However, it doesn't take long to learn the moves. Within a week or two, i now know almost all of the moves and steps in most of the songs. I personally never used any of the learning tutorials and went straight to the actual dancing. It is also great because you can adjust the intensity to make the game easy (for beginners) or more difficult (for people like me who have experience with zumba).I personally prefer the girl instructor routines than the advanced routines with the guy instructor. I don't know why but I find it harder to keep up with the routines that have the man instructor. This game is tons of fun, and offers several songs and routines. If you do well, and work out more intensity, the game will open up new background scenes. I love that it focuses mostly if not all of the routines on latin dances such as salsa, merengue, cumbia, reggaeton, etc unlike the wii zumba games which include a lot of dances that are not latin related. I primarily purchased zumba to learn to dance the latin dances, however, I found that you really do lose those pounds, and gain beautiful curves...like many women, I like to work out the lower body, especially my legs and hips and this game definitely does the job! I have noticed a big difference in my body and can go up flights of stairs without being out of breath. My only problem with this game is that the belt does not stay on in one place. As you dance and sweat, it gets loose and becomes really annoying. Therefore, I do not use the belt at all so that it doesn't distract me from working out and having fun. The game still works well if I just use the motion controller. Remember that you must have the playstation eye and motion controller in order to play this game! Other than that, it is really great and I would highly recommend it!\n",

      "If you know what this package is going in, you have a better chance of liking it.  A lot of people have (understandably) trashed \"Hasbro Family Game Night 3\" simply because the 5 games they included aren't the original games we grew up with.I won't sugarcoat it: There are some seriously puzzling decisions going on here.  I think this collection of party games is okay, but not great.  There's some fun to be had, but nothing to guarantee a satisfying purchase.NOTE - Every game has a Regular Mode and a Remix ModeTWISTERLet's get the elephant in the room out of the way, both Modes for this game suck.  It's like \"Guitar Hero\" or \"Dance Dance Revolution\", and doesn't even remotely resemble a game of Twister.  All you do is press the controller buttons to match the screen, and it's all done to a short selection of cheesy music that lasts about 30-60 seconds tops per session.  Honestly, Twister on this disc just sucks.MOUSE TRAPThe Regular Mode is perhaps the most faithful to the board game from this PS3 disc.  Instead of building the Mouse Trap machine itself, you play a short minigame to determine how many pieces get built at a time.  The videogame does a better job of building the machine, obviously.  Let's face it --- the real thing was a pain in the butt.  On the other hand, rather than watching a real-life marble contraption, you watch a video game do it for you, which isn't as much fun if you ask me.The Remix Mode is a neat change of pace.  You basically roll the dice to maneuver a figure-8 style board, collect cheese, and construct mini-traps that hurt both you AND the other players.  Nothing special, but it's still fun for a few playthroughs.I like Mouse Trap the board game, but I don't love it.  So, the videogame gets the same recommendation from me.YAHTZEE HANDS DOWNThis game probably has the most replay value in the back.  Instead of rolling dice to win Yahtzee combinations, players are dealt playing cards to try to match the combination in the middle of the board.  Players can swap out cards, hoping their next turn will reveal better results.  The game itself is pretty solid, but the AI will occasionally give up cards that could've helped their own hands.  Other than that, it's a good one.THE GAME OF LIFENow, this is more like it!  I don't remember the board game very well, but with the Regular Mode, the basic concepts of choosing Career-vs-College, raising a family, spinning the wheel to move, and trying to make the most money are in tact.  There are a few silly variations, like playing simple minigames instead of choosing cards from a deck.  Most of these minigames are fun, but it sucks that the Getting Married space always makes you do this stupid dance minigame like Twister.The Remix Mode is basically the same game, except you get rewarded and penalized with move spaces, and there's no money involved.  First player to reach the end wins the game.  Simple, but a decent alternative to those who don't enjoy the money management.I'm also disappointed that you can't look at the whole game board very clearly.  But I still had fun, and have played several times alone and with my wife.  We both find The Game of Life to be a fun diversion.CLUE/CLUEDOOddly enough, this is very faithful to original board game, and its changes are solid choices for a videogame adaptation.  Instead of just doing the traditional checklist of murder clues, you have to earn the right to narrow your search by landing on spaces that give you Rumor Points.  Play any of a few minigames, fill up your Rumor Point meter, and investigate away.  The videogame does a poor job of explaining the intricacies, but once you get the hang of it, it works very well.The Remix Mode is also a lot of fun.  Before rolling your dice, there's an Event Die that changes things up.  A pool party resets the players & suspects around the game board, while other rolls will eliminate possible rooms & suspects.  I prefer the slower-paced Regular Mode, but my wife and I both loved the craziness from Remix ModeClue/Cluedo is my easily favorite of the pack.OVERALLMy Reactions:+ Twister sucks.+ Mouse Trap is decent.+ Yahtzee Hands Down is quite good.+ The Game of Life is worth playing again and again.+ Clue/Cluedo is easily the best of the bunch.My wife pretty much agrees with me, except she prefers The Game of Life over Clue.  We both loved playing those two games the most.It's very simple: The board games are better than what this videogame disc provides for you, and this disc doesn't do a good job explaining how to play these games (except for the embarrassing Twister).  Twister is a huge letdown.  Mouse Trap is perhaps too faithful to the board game, but it's decent.  Yahtzee Hands Down is its own style, but still very fun.  Thankfully, Clue/Cluedo and The Game of Life are solid adaptations of the classic games, with acceptable/forgivable changes.There are some unlockables, but the game does a terrible job of explaining where they are with even those!  And even though I love PS3 Trophies, they never make or break the quality of a game.I suggest you just find some buddies and play the old-school board games, or go online and find some way of playing games more faithful to the original versions.  But if you're really desperately looking for a PS3 disc that people can play these games on --- and understand that they're very different versions --- then pay 20 dollars at the most.If you have friends to play with (online or offline), then \"Hasbro Family Game Night 3\" is a fun way to kill a few hours here and there.  But if you're playing solo against the computer, just skip it.\n",

      "Last year, gamers really started to go wild for the Nintendo DS all over again. Not just because of the DS which was redesigned into the DS Lite, but a whole new era of mental challenge games attracted new gamers young and old. Mainly, with Brain Age, the Nintendo DS got older gamers into the scheme of gaming and excitement from verbal memory games, to introducing Su Doku, the challenging puzzle game that have really made gamers go wild. Unfortunately, there have been many knockoffs to Brain Age like Mind Quiz for the PSP, that really haven't delivered and attracted the feeling that Brain Age delivered. Now, a sequel to the original mind bender that started it all, returns to the Nintendo DS, but is it good as it was before, or falls short on memory?Brain Age 2 for the Nintendo DS tackles on more exciting puzzles than before. The gameplay is expanded nicely, but there are also a lot of changes to the gameplay here in the game. The first main change is that a lot of the verbal games like the color strooping exam were removed, because there were a lot of problems with the microphone use in the game. Instead, there are a lot more games that feed off nicely from Nintendo's other DS mind-bender Big Brain Academy here, where you have to comprehend how much you have to give back as change in dollars and cents, to memorizing a song on a piano. Another new game is called word wheel, where you have a series of letters spinning around, and you have to fill in the exact word, one letter at a time. There are also a few things that have returned here, including the picture drawing challenges, but especially the Su Doku puzzles, withe over 100 new puzzles to test your mind. The graphics are just as simple as they were before, but the gameplay is just even more addictive than it has been before, and the control also handles that just as well.All in all, with so many mental games in the video game market right now, Brain Age 2 really does deliver nicely for the Nintendo DS. If you haven't tackled the challenges before, you may want a new mind-reading workout. I loved the original one, and I really like the new addictive challenges. I absolutely suggest you buy this sequel, and keep that brain sharp.Graphics: BSound: B 1/2+Control: B+Fun & Enjoyment: B+Overall: B+\n",

      "If your an older gamer or just someone who likes older game series you have probaly played Megaman (the original series not X,Legends,Zero,or Battle Network) I remember when I first got my NES when I was 5 and Megaman 2 I loved that game and still do so I saw Megaman 8 for playstaition decided I should check up on this series (I'm more of a Megaman X fan) from the opening movie which is shown in stunning anime to the ending credits this game is flawless the story begins with 2 strange robots fighting in the deep reaches of space when they injure each other so bad that they crash land into earth and Megaman heads to investigate when he gets there Dr. Wily (for you noobs Megaman's main enemy) is carrying off one of the robots which has very evil very powerful energy Wily is harnesting so Megaman helps the second robot and heads after Wily so the battle begins with your standard 4 bosses Clownman,Grenademan,Frostman, and Tenguman(my personal favorite) and after they are done your next four appear Swordman,Astroman,Searchman, and Aquaman(not to be confused with the DC comics hero) you Megaman veterans already know where this is going even though the game is standard Megaman format that same format is perfect and if it ain't broke don't fix itGraphics wise the game rules its 2D but very good looking 2D the enemies and backgrounds are very detailed I could just stare at them all day but I won't but anyway you older gamers will admit this is a huge step up from NES and SNES(remember the old square shots that would pass off as bullets in the old games?) Megamans graphics Megas little pellet shots even look good his charge up shots have detail and just the basic movements of running jumping and sliding look pretty goodSound hows the sound you ask? Great the music for each stage is good and even the voice acting in the cut scences is nicely matched also having the cut scences in anime was a great idea seeing Bass and Megaman duke it out in anime is really great to see it really makes the carnival level more fun when you have carnival music as your background all also when you're going through a labyrinth in Astromans stage the music really sets the mood for how strange the level is these are just some examples as all the music really does a good job of setting the mood for funFun factor is what makes this game so great is that there are so many diverse challenges in levels and ways of getting around such as snowboarding,flying via the Rush Jet and even swinging on vines in a jungle so many robots to destroy so little time also there are added challenges like finding 40 bolts that Roll (once again for you noobs Megaman's sister) will make upgrades for Megaman with and its not as hard as some other Megaman installments so if you're rusty on the series or new to it this would be a good place to start basic Megaman formula still is around if you beat a boss you obtain his power example: if you beat Clownman you get his power the Thunder Claw even though I have beaten the game several times I still find myself playing itThe Bottom line here is that Megaman 8 is another perfect Megaman game that seems to just get better with every installment that needs to be in everyones Playstaition collection 10/10By the way for those of you who agree with my review lets hope for Megaman 9 soon\n",

      "every 3 or 4 years, SEGA pushes out another sonic game with the nintendoversion being the best versions. it's been sonic's basic rule to do thebest he can on nitendo systems, with his newest game being no exception,but that's not saying that the 360 version is bad, oh no no NO! it is acually one of the best to date! it is just held down by stuff the wii version didn't have, and has stuff that is better than the wii's, just not as many.first lets talk about the blue blur himself. in his stages, you don't feel the blues at all. he is extremely fast and fun, with his levels  being beautiful looking and have some good and bad design. the good design is that, with practice, you can memorize them and when you're good enough, fly by at super sonic speeds easily. and you can put you're time on a leader board, at least that is what it says on the back of the game cover. the replay value is extremely high, with dozens of twists and turns to take. the down side to the speed levels are the following: 1, there are not enough. there are only 9 speed levels. 9 i tell ya! they consist of 2 or 3 acts. the 1st act is the one you normally play, while the other acts optional, and trust me, they SHOULD be optional. they are so hard and frustrating, it's just not worth it. any way, sonic comes with old and some new moves. each being good, and with their share of flaws. the sonic drift is one, while it helps you turn, you still just don't turn sharp enough. most of the time, it will intead of helping you, kill you most of the time you use it. sonic's controls are problomatic at points. his turning is good while he's boosting, but when he's not, it's a little too loose, but most of the time, you'll be boosting anyway. his braking is awful. it taks him too long to stop, plain and simple. the jumping can also be untrust worthy, but it's not that bad. that's pretty much it for the hedgehog...But what about the werehog? to keep a long story short, just don't play as him, regardless of the version. his levels are bassic platforming, but that's just it, BASIC PLATFORMING. it has nothing interesting about it. the guns in Shadow The Hedgehog were funner than this! the levles are TOO long, from 10 to 30 minutes each, no joke. the fighting is pointless and the upgrading system too. you don't need it because you basically win with the Y button, end of story.overall, SEGA said they were aiming for the best sonic game ever, and got really close, but anchored it down with a lousy, boring, and stupid werehog, a WEREHOG!!! HAVE YOU HERD OF SUCH A THING??? well, now you have. don't be fooled, it's a good game though. the day stages are THAT fun, seriously, they are. and since the day stages are the thing that you'll spend the most time replaying, i recomend the wii version. it is missing 2 levels, but it's still a great game. if you don't own a wii, don't be afraid of getting the 360 version. it's a good game, just not as good as the wii version. it's not that it sucks to the wii version, it's just not as thought out. now my final words are... SEGA, GET A STUPID DOG CATCHER AND TAKE THE WEREHOG TO THE POUND PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n",

      "Sonic Heroes has all that a game could have, kind of.  The switching characters can get get confusing and the bosses seem easier than in other Sonic games.  Other than those two minor things the levels get repeatitive, pretty much all the levels are like SA2(Sonic Adventure 2).  But the bosses vary, and the three characters are awesome, the graphics rule and you finally get to see the Chaotix in action!  The four teams are Team Sonic, Team Dark , Team Rose and Team Chaotix.  Team Sonic consists of, you guessed it, our heroes, Sonic, Tails and Knuckles.  Team Dark has Rouge, a renegade robot named Omega and (surprise)Shadow(Shadow has amnesia so you won't get how he survid in SA2).  Team Rose-Amy, Cream, and Big.  Finally, Team Chaotix, Vector, Charmy and Espio.  Oh, Eggman has the same idea as always TAKE OVER THE WORLD!!  Not to mention an old enemy of Sonic comes back too... Go out and with Sonic speed get this game before Eggman does!!\n",

      "Final Fight is one of my favorite games of all time. When it hit Arcades in 1989 it was an instant classic hit. It came before Double Dragon and Streets of Rage and spawned many clones (a lot from Capcom like Alien vs. Predator and Cadillacs & Dinosaurs), which tried to gain on the success of this awesome game. Some played great like Konami's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, X-Men, and The Simpsons. Some were terrible like Irem's Undercover Cops.Capcom can be forgiven for this somewhat shoddy port of Final Fight to the Super NES because it was their first game developed for the system and the Super NES was a new system at the time. This port removes the 2 player feature, Guy, the Industrial Stage (Stage 5 I think if I can remember), smaller sprites and the amount of enemies on screen at the same time. Also female thugs Poison and Roxy are turned into transsexual punks Cid and Billy, plus boss Sodom's name is changed to Katana because Nintendo of America is so anal (pun intended! :) ). Otherwise this is a decent side-scrolling beat-em up and one of the best you can find. If you don't mind single player with only Haggar or Cody then you will enjoy. I recommend playing this game on MAME (emulation), going to an Arcade with classic games if you can still find one, playing Final Fight CD for Sega CD, Final Fight One for Game Boy Advance or getting Capcom Classics Collection Vol. 1 for PlayStation 2 and Xbox which has an Arcade perfect version of this game and others. Still this game is pretty good overall.\n",

      "Well, after hearing all of the negative views from people about Treyarch doing another Call of Duty game, you'd think that this game would be a completely unplayable pile of crap.  But after playing the game, I honestly can't see what people were so worried about.  Did you like Call of Duty 4?  Then you're going to like this game.  You may not feel it's worth $[...] for WWII skins, a new story mode, and (almost) the exact same multiplayer as Modern Warfare, but I feel like it's been money well spent. (POSSIBLE MINOR SPOILERS)The campaign mode is incredible.  I love that they actually used real life campaigns and even footage from those campaigns to try to show you what it was like.  And you can obviously tell that Treyarch did their homework.  Everything in the game looks incredible, from the bombed out ruins of a Russian City, to the islands in the Pacific, everything looks great.  It is a little different getting used to the older weapons, no laser sights and all, but once you get used to it it's really not bad.  You will recognize some of the mission types, there is a sniper level and there is a gunner on a plane level, but both are different enough that they don't just feel like a rehash.  I gotta admit, I'm not a big fan of the tank level, it feels to slow and clunky for me when I'm used to COD being so run and gun, but maybe that's just me.  One thing that bugged me was the collision detection seemed a bit off.  There were a couple of times when I got stuck in branches or in holes on the ground and had to wait to die cause I couldn't move anywhere.The COD multiplayer returns in all of it's glory.  Most of the perks from the previous iteration return in some form or another, and there are a handful of new ones.  It is interesting how instead of doing helicopter strikes and such they put in dogs instead.  Honestly, I think those things keep me on my toes more than enemy players.  The maps really give you room to spread out to find a hiding position, but there are some that are small enough that you can get yourself an old school bloodbath going if that's what you want.One thing about the story, I know that COD4 took the storytelling to a whole new level, but honestly, it seems like every mission someone either dramatically gets killed or you are seemingly killed. Your Russian character in the game is captured and/or nearly killed in every freakin mission.  I realize WWII was dangerous, but not every moment had a stunning back from the dead victory.  And the Zombie mode, I HATE the Zombie mode.  I'm fine with survival horror/zombie games...but I honestly don't think it mixes well with COD.  I guess when I pop one of these games in I'm looking for my run and gun, practically limitless ammo experience...not saving every bullet and running around in a small room waiting to die.  Maybe it's just not for me.All in all, I'd give it 4.5 stars.  It's an awesome return to the Call of Duty franchise that really earns it's stars.  I know a lot of people have bad memories from Treyarch's last COD, but considering they basically just used what Modern Warfare had and built on it, it really can't be that bad.  Although I will admit that I just got into FPS' and Call of Duty through Modern Warfare so I haven't had time to get sick of WWII shooters.  Either way, it's a great game, and a really cinematic way to (kind of) experience some of the battles of WWII.  And the Multiplayer is still some of the best in the business.  Unless you think of it as a WWII skin for COD4, there's really not a good reason for you not to get this.\n",

      "European Assault is a very good game, and certainly the best MOH yet, even better than Frontline.  You play as Lt. William Holt working for the OSS.  And unlike previous MOH's, in European Assault, you actually have three squad mates with you during each mission.  You can position them where you want and they will take out the enemy, so you don't die.  That's another thing, the AI in this game is superb.  You squad does not just sit there and make you do all the work.  And the enemy AI is just as good.  The Germans will shoot if you do not take cover, and they don't just stand in the middle of nowhere, just waiting to be shot.  They hide behind anything that will keep them from dying. And they pop up out of a shrub or brush and scare the living daylights out of you.  You must have quick reflexes to play this game. The one fault with the AI is that the enemy is very predictable and do the same actions over and over again.The gameplay and the maps are the best I've seen.  Each mission is not just a path to victory.  You have to explore to find the best way to achieve your goals, and there are many goals in one mission.  For instance, you have a primary objective and then you have 2,3,4, or even 5 secondary objectives to achieve.  The way you want to go about doing them is up to you.  Also, in each mission, there is a high ranking German officer that you must kill.  These guys don't die easily and you have to put up a fight.  The missions in this game are extremely hard the first time you play, because everything is unpredictable and there are many surprises along the way.  But after that, it becomes fairly easy, but still pretty hard.  O yeah, did I mention that that was on the lowest difficulty level.  I haven't played the on the next three difficulty levels, but I'm sure they are pretty hard if I had trouble with the lowest level.  On each mission, there are available medkits throughout the map ( except on the highest difficulty), which will help heal you and your squad mates.  Be sure to use them wisely.The guns in this game are great, with a very wide variety, however, you only get to hold two at a time.  The German tiger tanks look exactly like the real thing, and they are very hard to destroy, even with a bazooka.  The sound effects are THE BEST ever.  Each gun has its own unique sound.  You hear, and feel, bombs go off next to you.  Listening for the movement of the tiger tanks makes you feel like you are actually on the battlefield.  The graphics are above average, but dont compare to Halo 2 or Chaos Theory.  (NOTE: you know when there are people next to you in a game and you kinda get stuck in a corner and can't move.  The guys at EA games did not allow that in this game.  Instead, you can walk through the people(if they're not German enemies) so you do not get annoyed and have to restart the mission.  Now, my friend thinks this is poor graphics, but believe me, it is a good thing and keeps you from getting frustrated.)  I was very dissapointed that there was no XBOX LIVE, because it would have been awesome.  However, the MULTIPLAYER is very good and a nice treat for you and your friends.The ending to this game (The Battle of the Bulge) (VERY HARD TO COMPLETE) leaves one to believe there will be another MOH coming in the future(...).  Wonder when it will come out.  Hopefully, EA Games will make the game EVEN MORE better than European Assault, with better everything and hopefully (and finally) XBOX LIVE for Medal of Honor.\n",

      "Considering how much i hated Call of Duty 3..i wasn't looking forward to another WW2 shoot em up. And it seems neither was Activision as the developers decided to take the COD franchise in a new directionHello fictional yet modern day warfare!Like most of Call of Duty games. The action is pretty intense and exciting. Never a dull moment. Unlike most COD games, the multiplayer as been changed to be ten times better then previous installmentsThe multiplayer on Xbox live sort of resembles something like Battlefield 2. In which you fight matches and gain xp. The more xp and challenges beat, the more unlockables you can get. And wow are their a lot of unlockables! You can unlock everything from new weapons, new perks, to new multiplayer type games even. Going on a kill streak in a game will allow you to really bring the ownage in terms of calling a helicopter or air strike to rain hell and fury on your enemy. This is of course the difference from previous games. Their are probably millions of ways to kill your enemy in multiplayer and you'll probably want to switch weapons often just to beat the challenges and unlock more stuff.The single player is fun although pretty short. You mostly play as the SAS although their are also a few USMC missions. Like most COD's, it feels like it's you vs an entire army at times. But that is of course the fun of a COD game. The AI is pretty intelligent and will throw back grenades and give a last ditch effort to kill you when they're about to die. The coolest mission is probably the Spectre gunner mission in which you rain death from above on you're enemies, nothing cooler then killing a group of enemies with one shoot from the Spectre cannon. A sniper mission that takes place in Chernobyl is also a fun mission that adds elements of stealth to a pretty much run and gun gameWhen you completed the game you unlock \"Arcade mode\" which takes the single player experience to a whole new level. In this mode you are timed in each mission and have to score as many points as possible. Head shots as well as kill streaks boost your score up while dying and lost of time will hurt it. It allows for some replay if the player isn't interested in multiplayerGraphics and Sound are good as well. Music is kind of repetitive but then again it really won't matter over the sounds of explosions and bullets.All in all..this game is a must have! I can't think of anything bad to say about this game....\n",

      "The Good: The best tactical shooter too date, decent length, excellent multiplayer, lots of cussing, lots of customization optionsThe Bad: Poor graphics, feels more like an expansion pack than a sequelFor some reason \"expansion pack\" type \"sequels\" is what Ubisoft keeps pumping out for it's Tom Clancy games. I recently did a review of GRAW 2 and complained about this exact same issue. Nonetheless R6V2 is a great tactical shooter and there is more good going for it than bad. Everyone's played the first game so I'll leave out what you already know. Some great new features is the new sprint. While I didn't use this much it's great for running down long hallways to get to where you need too.There are some new guns (I don't know what's new but I know there's new guns) and the multiplayer is as awesome as ever. Another new feature is the \"Terrorist Hunt\" mode in which you pick your level and hunt down all the terrorist either by yourself or cooperatively. The story is pretty good as well. You have to fight the Mexican terrorists from destroying and terrorizing Vegas while also hunting down a traitor among the Rainbows. The graphics are very disappointing. For using the Unreal 3 engine you think the graphics would blow you away but they are very weak. The game isn't much to look at, but you just play for the easy pick up and play tactical greatness. The game has a decent length (coming in at about 8 hours) and has a highly unbalanced difficulty which sucks since you'll try doing the same areas until your fingers bleed.If you liked Vegas 1 you'll love Vegas 2 but this game is only for R6 fans. If you have never played the first game (you can pick it up for $20 or so on eBay) then go ahead and pick this game up.\n",

      "I'd heard about Half-Life--this supposedly incredible game from Sierra. But I'm not a fan of the first person shooter, so I thought, &quot;Why  bother?&quot; But because I was curious about all the hype, I decided to go  ahead and download the demo. That's all it took, and I was hooked.I  immediately went out and bought the Adrenaline Pack and have LOVED it.  Maybe it the intensity of the gameplay. Maybe it's the beautiful graphics.  Maybe it's the realism, music, and sound. Maybe it's the sheer fun. But in  any event, it's the 1st first-person shooter I've really REALLY had fun  with since the initial DOOM days, and worth every penny.Yes, Team  Fortess (which you play with against others over the internet) is a free  download you can get with the Half-Life game, which is cheaper, but you'll  want Oppossing Forces as well, so get it. To give you a low-down on the  difference between the other two games, in Half-Life, you're alone (for the  most part) and fighting your way out of the Black Mesa facility. In  Opposing Force, your the Opposing Force to the guy you played in Half-Life,  but you're not alone. Many times you'll find yourself leading a squad of  rough and tough soldiers with different special abilities, and it's intense  and realistic!Cool features: Turn on/off blood. It matters where you  shoot creatures and/or people to determine how injured they become (unlike  Quake), and can outright die with one shot if well placed. (Aim for the  head!) The sniper rifle is VERY sweet. And finally, as your team members  get injured, it's visible in how they talk and walk. (They LIMP, if you can  believe it, so you have to wait for them as they lag behind!)Overall,  very cool game, very cool gameplay, very realistic and VERY fun. A must for  the die-hard gamer, or for someone who's not, like myself! (I NEVER buy  games when they first come out. Just too expensive. But this one, I made an  exception for, and haven't regretted it one bit.\n",
