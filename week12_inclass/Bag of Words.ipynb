      "Installing the game was a struggle (because of games for windows live bugs).Some championship races and cars can only be \"unlocked\" by buying them as an addon to the game. I paid nearly 30 dollars when the game was new. I don't like the idea that I have to keep paying to keep playing.I noticed no improvement in the physics or graphics compared to Dirt 2.I tossed it in the garbage and vowed never to buy another codemasters game. I'm really tired of arcade style rally/racing games anyway.I'll continue to get my fix from Richard Burns Rally, and you should to. :)http://www.amazon.com/Richard-Burns-Rally-PC/dp/B000C97156/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid;=1341886844&sr;=8-1&keywords;=richard+burns+rallyThank you for reading my review!

      "In my opinion, this is one of the best Sonic games ever released. It makes up for what I believe Sonic 3 lacks. Sonic and Knuckles is actually a continuation of Sonic 3's story, and features the notorious Knuckles the Echidna as one of the main characters. You can either play Sonic or Knuckles in this game, Knuckles having a little less playing time (with fewer levels and all) and slight variations in the game (for different points of view). Let me go about my opinionated statistics:Levels: Huge and often challenging. They're very detailed and are all extremely original (although some parts of certain levels remind me of old Sonic games, like certain things in Flying Battery Zone remind me of Metropolis Zone in Sonic 2).Grade: 10/10Best Level: Flying Battery Zone (2nd level), and Death Egg Zone (7th level, Sonic only)Graphics: Beautiful, clear, and colorful. Very similar to Sonic 3.Grade: 10/10Bonus/Emerald Rounds: The Bonus rounds are new, one containing spheres where you spin around and try to catch rings/more lives/shields, and a slot round where you can gain/lose rings from a slot machine that you spin around it (think Casino Night Zone in Sonic 2). I like the sphere round a lot but I don't care for the slot round because you can lose rings. Also, in Sonic and Knuckles, you don't have to have 50 rings to enter a round like you do in Sonic 3. The Emerald rounds have different versions, but generally they're the same as Sonic 3 (get the blue spheres, if you touch a red sphere you're out, etc. etc.)Grade: 9/10Characters: Sonic and Knuckles are both interesting characters to play, although I admit I do miss Tails a lot.Grade: 8.5/10Music: The music I believe is one of the best parts of Sonic and Knuckles. The music is VERY catchy and I love it. The Flying Battery Zone theme, Lava Reef Zone theme, and the Death Egg Zone theme are the best in my opinion, but I believe every level theme has it's charms.Grade: 10/10Bosses: Some can be challenging, but I found that some of them actually are a little too easy. One thing I like though is that there's a boss after most of the zones, and not one just after every level (which is similar to Sonic 3).Grade 8/10The only thing Sonic and Knuckles really lacks is special features, basically having no verses mode or options menu. You cannot save games either like you can in Sonic 3. The only real special feature that Sonic and Knuckles has is it's connectability. Sonic and Knuckles in itself is a separate game, but it can also be connected to Sonic 2 or Sonic 3 for alternative games.If you connect it to Sonic 2, it becomes Sonic 2 and Knuckles, and it's basically Knuckles playing through all the Sonic 2 levels. This might not seem very new to most people, but with Knuckle's climbing and gliding abilities, you can often explore parts of the levels in Sonic 2 that you were never able to do before.However, when you connect the game to Sonic 3, you get possibly one of the greatest Sonic gaming experiences ever. If you play Sonic 3 and Knuckles, you are able to play through all the Sonic 3 and Sonic and Knuckles levels with Sonic, Knuckles, or Tails. You get all the extra features of Sonic 3 (verses mode, saving abilities, etc.) With exception to the Sonic 3 level themes, all the sounds throughout the game are Sonic and Knuckles based, and you have access to all three bonus rounds (the gumball round from Sonic 3 and the sphere and slot rounds from Sonic and Knuckles), and obviously, twice as many emeralds to get. If you obtain all the emeralds, you can become either Hyper Sonic or Hyper Knuckles, which is also pretty cool. Even Tails has a Super mode! Basically, for all Sonic 3 and Sonic and Knuckles lacks as separate games, Sonic 3 and Knuckles makes up for it with unbelieveable gaming fun! It is the epitome of Sonic gaming and is the model for all Sonic games.It's unfortunate that Sonic and Knuckles is so rare now, but I HIGHLY recommend it for anyone who's into Sonic gaming. Get one now before it's too late!Overall game review: 10/10\n",

      "I have been a Sonic fan since the beginning. I had played every single Sonic game for the Genesis. I had watched Sonic cartoon episodes and the Sonic movie countless times. I had read as many Sonic comics as I could handle. I crammed my head with as much stuff about Sonic as I could. I even created my own Sonic website. But, after a while the same old levels on the original Sonic games got old. I needed something new. I needed something fresh. Then, I heard about Sonic Adventure. Just because of me being a Sonic fanatic, Sonic Adventure and the Dreamcast were at the top of my Christmas list. Finally, I received it along with a Dreamcast and popped it in. As soon as the opening sequence began, I was stunned. I was amazed at the great graphics and use of real music with vocals and all. Plus, Sonic looked cooler than ever. Then, the game got even better because of the ability to be 6 different classic Sonic characters and some new ones. The game is perfect because each character has a different story line that blends in with another character's story. Plus, the classic Sonic and Tails brothership and Sonic and Knuckles competivness still remain. If you are a true Sonic fan like me, though, you might be a little disappointed. The game missed many classic Sonic elements and Sonic's orgin is totally changed. The Freedom Fighters are gone, Sonic lives on Earth instead of Mobius, and Tails' age has gone up by 6 years while Sonic's only has risen by 1. Plus, Sonic Adventure is more childish than previous Sonic games because of the Chao pets. The game should be more focused one defeating Robotnik instead of raising a little pet.Still, the game has the classic Sonic feel to it because the chaos emeralds are still intact, and when you collect them you can become an even better Super Sonic than the one in the previous years. Other great additions include mini-games and 3-D cinema scenes. One of the best parts of the game is the re-make of the original Ice Cap stage from Sonic 3 and the ability to ride a snowboard that you can actually control, unlike in the original. If you are a Sonic fan, this is a must-have.\n",

      "LA Noire is from RockStar and Team Bondi. It puts you into the shoes of a cop of the rise named Cole Phelps. You'll get the chance to solve case for multiple different departments within the LAPD. You'll find yourself in the Traffic division, Homicide, VICE, and Arson. You'll have to track down all the clues and get your witnesses and suspects to tell you exactly what you need to do. If you can accomplish all of this you might find yourself as one of the best in LA.Graphically this game starts off stunning. The lay out of the city looks spot on, the characters that you'll interact with will have you constantly thinking, haven't I seen that face before, somewhere else? There's also the long list of vehicles that you'll have at your disposal. The one thing that is revolutionary is the face tracking technology, and you're going to have to use it if you're going to be able to find out what you need to know. The odd thing though is that as you play the game the graphics actually seem to decay. You'll noice more and more texture pop as you go on, and the characters also seem to decline in appearance. I noticed near the end of the game that several of the characters' mouths will appear to be melting.The music of the game definitely gives you that 1940's vibe. The voice acting really sells the story when you couple it with the faces that you'll be encountering.The controls are for the most part easy to pick up and will be your best friend. There are some issues when you're trying to get in and out of cover with the shoulder button, but other than that you'll find that you won't have too many issues with your controls.As stated before you're a cop in 1947 name Cole Phelps. You'll get your chance to show that you're a star pretty quick off the bat, and as you continue to complete cases you might just get those promotions. There's a set number of cases for each division and you'll be ranked on how well you collected all the clues, got the correct answers, and caused minimal damage to cars, the city, and individuals walking the city. You'll also find that there are other crimes that you'll pick up on over the radio, and you can choose to complete those as well. The better you do with the questioning and taking on the street crimes the higher you'll rank up. As you rank up you'll have access to other suits, and you'll also get rewarded with Intuition Points that you can use to either remove wrong answers from your interrogation or you can pool the audience (if you're connected to XBL) to see what the most popular choices are.You'll find that this story will keep you pretty glued to your seat. I did have some issues with the VICE cases as I didn't really find them nearly as enjoyable as the Homicide cases, but the overall layout of the story, filled with twists, definitely kept bringing me back to this game.If you're looking to a Hard-Crime game in which you can sink your teeth into, then this is the game for you. If you're looking for a GTA type of game in which you play a cop, you might be slightly depressed as you won't be able to draw your weapon unless its a time for a gun fight. This game, even when the graphics starts to go, is something that you need to get. This game gets an 8.7 out of 10.\n",

      "When I first played Onimusha Warlords I thought it was just another samurai game... at that time I was seeing Onimusha 3 teasers and they were really cool... When I began playing the game itself, well... there's a lot of chattering in the beginning, there's some demons (Genma) that you need to kill with just your blade (explanations later) and there are some nasty chicken-like folks who lock you in a place to fight some Genma just because they were afraid... since you're a samurai it's OK I guess... after that you meet Kaede (she's a kunoichi I think) looks like she's Samanosuke's(your character) old friend as far as the dialog goes... and *spoiler* you get to play a part with her , but I can't give more spoilers on that *spoiler end*Well, after all that cute dialog and they parting ways, the game really starts but I'm sorry to say, you'll be beaten to a pulp by the first enemy and the sneaky ninjas who are REALLY fast (movement and attack speed-wise) THEN you'll receive a special visit from the Oni clan and they'll grant you another life and a source of their power, their gauntlet, which you'll use to find orbs and these orbs will give you a new weapon and powers (and the ability to capture dead Genma souls, think of that as your money from this moment on because you'll need a LOT of souls in the game)! (when I said \"just\" your blade a while back I meant he has his samurai sword (which is weak) and he'll get additional weapons during the game, which can be upgraded using Genma souls)As the game goes on you'll face the 1st boss that you can really kill, and man, it's VERY hard for beginners, since Onimusha Warlords ALWAYS start at normal difficulty and you can only harden the game (until you die 10 times doing the same thing, and it might happen on this boss...) after you've defeated this boss you'll receive A LOT of Genma souls (bosses have to drop more, right?) and if you did that in the standard difficulty (or any other, probably) the game won't get harder in a long while, in my opinion... later on the game you'll find a strange guy with magic seals on him and he himself looks like a roach in a cocoon... remember the places he'll appear and if you're good enough, accept his challenge and go to the dungeons, which I can't remember the name right now :( but they'll lead you to many items and in the end of the game you'll not regret that, I guarantee.During the game you'll find many scrolls around, save them because some of them can explain the game plot and some others teach you some Oni language (needed to unlock special chests which can boost your total HP and Mana bars, and some other goodies too) , you'll also find many bosses (some of them really challenging), many puzzles (and a lot of them may get you killed if you make a mistake or if you're not fast enough to solve it) you'll also find some armor (well, makes sense since you find weapons but the armors are not sponsored by an Oni orb, so you'll have to find them in some hidden places... Also, in the beginning of the game you'll see a harmless puzzle (a numeric sequence... if you fail to do it you'll just have to try again... all puzzles related to chests are harmless, puzzles related to the game may get you killed, keep that in mind.)Oh well, I think I said enough about the game, even though I wanted to say even more :D I really can't say more without spoiling the whole thing so you'll have to see for yourself :D\n",

      "I love the \"zombie apocalypse\" genre, enough so that when I saw Left 4 Dead on the shelf at Wallyworld for a measly $20 I had to buy it. I truly didn't know anything about it other than it involved zombies and a group of survivors trying to survive the zombie onslaught, but that was it. From the time I put the CD into my X-Box 360 a week ago until now I've had mixed feelings on this game and have struggled to quantify it and distill it down to its most basic elements.There's really not much of a plot here, but then again what plot do you really need for any kind of zombie infestation? Chances are there was a government experiement that got out of the laboratory and infected the masses, or perhaps some microbial organisms latched on to a satellite reentering the atmosphere and spread havoc upon an unsuspecting populace. It doesn't really matter since it always plays out the same way. Humans are transformed (either from the dead as in Night of the Living dead, or live ones are infected by a biological mutagen, as in 28 Days Later) and begin stalking those who haven't been infected or are still alive. Really, when you're talking about zombie outbreaks, that's all you really have to know. The game follows 4 \"immune\" survivors; Bill (retired Vietnam veteran), Francis (a biker/hoodlum), Francis (a former IT computer tech), and Zoey, a college student and horror movie fan. These are some of your archetypal figures you'll find in zombie movies. The four travel together in search of a way to get to safe havens of human habitation but have to pass through some pretty grisly zombie-infested locations to get from point A to B.Before we go any further it is absolutely necessary to say that Left 4 Dead is *not* a plot-driven FPS like Half Life so much as it is a team-oriented, multi-player zombie \"experience\", set in a sort of quasi-cinematic fashion. There are 4 \"episodes\" in Left 4 Dead and each takes the group through standard zombie infested settings one has probably seen in a zombie movie. I do not know if these episodes are meant to be linked together into one continguous narrative or if each is meant only to be played as a single experience, but the settings are quite nice and really make you feel like you're in a zombie afflicted locale. It's all there; the abandoned city, the farm house battle, the journey to make it to a boat that gets the players off of the mainland. Your goal is always to travel from point A to B and get to your means of escape, be it a helicopter, Air Force transport plane, or a lumbering APC coming to your rescue. Along the way players will hit checkpoints of a sort called Safe Houses. These safe havens are places to heal, restock ammo and first aid kits, and upgrade or change weapons too. There are four safe houses per episode and on the harder settings you'll feel like curling up there and just riding out the zombie apocalypse as long as you can. In some of these, scrawled on the walls, are messages from previous inhabitants which make a sort of low tech bulletin board system, some providing info on where to go, others leaving messages for loved ones they had to leave behind, and others (quite comically) flaming each other for having the wrong details on zombies in general. Each episode has a title card like a movie, with titles such as \"Blood Harvest\" and \"No Mercy\", and each episode ends with closing credits like a movie, with character stats in lieu of Director, Best Boy, and Actor credits, as well as a \"X number of Zombies were killed in this film\" statement. Nice touch!The game uses the Source engine, which powered such awesomeness as Portal and Half-Life 2, and it is beautiful here. But the fact is that as solid as the Source engine is it's not the Unreal engine, the behemoth that powered the beautiful Bioshock 1 & 2. That said this seems to be an advanced version of the Source engine and is fine tuned to be as pretty as I've ever seen from Valve's programming office. The flames in particular are surprsingly well rendered, although much of the surface details are plauged by pixelation and some strange clipping issues. If they included the Havok physics engine as they did with Half Life 2 I'm not seeing it here. The only time zombies seem to fly backwards is when I hit one with the shotgun...I'd have liked it better if they flopped around a bit more, but I can forgive this...at least a little bit. I also came across a few graphics from Half Life 2 in the Blood Harvest campaign, which sort of surprised me when I saw them. I half expected to see Gordon Freeman's Lambda symbol spraypainted somewhere.So far this sounds pretty good, right? Then why the 3 star rating? Well, for starters the game is simply not designed to be a single player game. But where Team Fortress 2 (from the same publisher even) makes for a quirky multi-player game this tends to be more of a run'n'gun experience, designed only to simulate a \"zombie experience\" by a group of players. Each of the characters in the game are identical in stats and each is limited to only a few weapons and supplies; a primary weapon (shotgun, M-16, hunting rifle, or Uzi), a secondary weapon with limitless ammo (a semi-automatic pistol which can be upgraded to two during the course of the game), a single grenade (Molotov cocktails or pipe bombs), a single first aid kit, and a bottle of pills, which temporarily gives the player health benefits without actually giving them health. Actually I found the pills to be next to worthless except when one is in a major pinch, but when times are hard and they're all you've got...well, you take them.The game is extremely repetitive, to the point where you can see the patterns in zombie spawning before they actually spawn. And spawn they will, from impossible locations usually, like the small closet which has only one door that you *just* cleared, but will vomit out 20+ zombies in a 10 seconds. And these zombies are more \"I Am Legend\" variety, moving fast and rigormortis-free, rather than straight Romero, shuffle and moan type. These zombies are fairly typical throughout the game and are pretty easily dispatched...however you will come across a few mutated varieties as well, such as the Hunter, which can leap amazing distances and land on a party member almost without warning. The Smoker typically stands around in hard to reach areas and uses its tongue in a freaky fashion, able to lash it like a whip and drag survivors away from the battle so it can begin to feed on them in privacy. The Boomer is a bloated fatbody that tends to spew some sort of zombie-attracting substance on you, usually at inopportune moments, and explodes like a bomb when you kill it. And the Tank is, as its name implies, a super-powerful gorilla like zombie that takes concentrated firepower to take down and can dish out a lot of melee damage. The last is the Witch. Now the Witch I find a bit puzzling...you can usually hear her from a good distance away, whining and moaning about being a zombified Witch I suppose, and can prepare accordingly. Shining your flashlight on her will get her riled up and make her attack (and she's a vicious one, my friends). The game seems to insinuate that you can bypass the Witch if need be but in only one case was I able to bypass her. In this regard I think the game is full of it...just shoot her, it'll save hearing that whiny, creepy sobbing she makes.The place where the ball was seriously dropped though is one of the things that Left 4 Dead purportedly has going for it...lack of a single player storyline mode. This lack of player driven story really soured the experience for me. I don't have an X-Box Gold account, so there's no way I can play this online, and after reading several other reviews I'm not sure I want to. A hyper 14 year old is going to bushwhack this not-so-agile 37 year old without much effort and I've read that you can experience that *only* if you're lucky enough to be allowed to stay in an online game in the first place. From what I've read there's supposed to be a split-screen capability, but my wife won't touch this game with a 12 foot pole and my younger brother, who might enjoy a game like this, comes over to visit only sporadically, which leaves me and 3 CPU controlled players. The computer players will shoot accurately enough but they never use grenades, which drives me up the wall at times, and come across as being there only to keep you alive when a Boomer unexpected rumbles out from behind an 18-wheeler. The computer players are there...they shoot at zombies and can be relied on to keep your back clear, and that's about it. From a single-player standpoint this game is mostly a failure for that very reason. I can see where a group of 4 friends would probably have a blast here, but without a single player story mode this game remains a mediocre game experience to me. And the tragedy here is that Left 4 Dead would be ideal for that type of play. The zombies themselves come out in single file, so someone with an M-16, for instance, can just take a bead on the lead zombie and with a few rounds take out the zombies right behind them. In several episodes you're given access to a military rotary cannon, but the cannon always has a poor field of fire, usually pointed at a location where few zombies will come at you, leaving you with an uber zombie killing machine that is essentially worthless. After a while Left 4 Dead just becomes a \"shoot anything that moves\" experience, rather than the visceral, scare-your-pants-off game it might have been. That's how Wolfenstein 3D worked...I never thought I'd see that mechanic in an FPS again, but here it is, \"reanimated\" for a whole new generation. One has limited use of tactics, such as holding an open window against an oncoming zombie horde, or blazing away at doorways that are about to be pounded down from zombies. Again, I can see where this game would probably be a real hoot for a group of players, but I don't have that capability, unfortunately, and have to rate it as I see it and experience it.Pros- Pretty, although slightly dated graphics- Decent weapons selection, with limited ammo capacity means you'll have to learn how to conserve ammo- Having scant supplies makes you yearn for those safe houses like you otherwise wouldn't- Nice flame effects- Thoroughly appropriate settings...custom made for the zombie apocalypse experience- Zombies are nicely rendered and often specific to their setting. At the airport you'll see pilot and flightline worker zombies. In the hospital, dead patients and doctor zombies, etc.- Fast, frenetic pace- Hey, it's a zombie game!Cons- The game is predictable- It's also extremely repetitive- Zombies conveniently line up for you to shoot them- The game focuses on multi-player to the detriment of the single-player experience- It could have had more storyline, although it's not required (as stated at the beginning)- After a few days the game gets kind of uninteresting- The rotary cannon is next to useless in most gamesLeft 4 Dead is a fairly mediocre game in my opinion, one that could have been much better had a little bit more elbow grease been put into it. It successfully captures the zombie theme but fails to fully implement it for player enjoyment, and is instead relegated to a fairly typical \"Run n' Gun\" shooter rather than a horror game. It could have been so much more...that's what makes me sad to give it only 3 stars.\n",

      "This is the first game I've purchased and played regularly in over three years except for Final Fantasy XI. Thanks to that game i've not found enough time for very many other games unfortunately. I am however a big fan of the Wii Virtual Console titles though I guess.I recently purchased a few new XBOX 360 games and tried to base all my purchases on reviews. My purchase of this game was based on a few reviews and on a very good trailer for the game.Put in the game and found the controls to be very hard to get used to. I'm one of those weird people who press up to look down and press right to look left. Of course it didn't take long to adjust to this. It seems that most Xbox 360 games do not have setting to invert both the X and Y axis. No big deal.My character of course starts out as a kid and when I become an adult I'm told to wait for Theresa to continue the main storyline. Of course I spend the next two days wandering around Bowerstone just doing random things for fun. Mostly annoying people or trying to make money. I took on the Blacksmith job and got to level 5 and made around 65k the first day to make enough money to buy some real estate. It's best to purchase cheap stalls and work your way up. I increased the prices on the Liquor store by a lot and of course that's not a good idea to this game and all the drunks in the game would get mad at me! My first thought on the first day was that this game is going to take forever to finish and that there's way to much to do in this game. That's unfortunately not true.After the first few days of wasting time in the main village I decided to get into the game for real. The combat is pretty much the best. I couldn't have hoped for something better really. Some people could say it's simply button smashing, but I don't really think so. What's especially cool is being able to use a pistol and zoom in for head shots and hit people from a distance. Often i'd get into the habit of trying to kill off all the enemies with just a pistol or when I got really good, just do head shots on everyone.I may sound like i'm an evil character, but i'm not. In the game I was so good that I actually had a halo. Strangely though after the first day I got so fat due to me taking 4 drinks in a row in the bar for fun. I also later found out that I was 100% corrupt and my character looked sickly. Of course I found out that it was because I jacked up the prices on too many rental properties to make money.Through the whole game, not once was I confused where to go next and what to do. In some ways, that can be a negative. I did go out exploring, but having every single thing pointed out to you gets a bit old. Yes I know that I can remove the \"yellow line\" thing.I honestly loved this game so much at first that I was telling everyone about it. At first I thought it was one of the best games I had played in years. Absolutely NOTHING in the game felt like a chore to do. Pretty much every single thing in the game was fun.I worked extra hard to take work off early just to play this game (I work at home) and managed to finish this game in less than a week after I purchased it. Please note that i'm not one of those hardcore gamers or whatever you want to call them. I only play games when I have free time. I will admit that often i'd play this game on my day off for up to five hours.So here I was at the end of the game. I figured there would be a lot to do. At the end of the game I had about 250k. I'm sure a lot of people have had more than that, but I didn't spend a ton of time making money. I also got into a bad habit of buying way to many weapons. The first thing I did was buy as much real estate as I possibly could. This includes buying any shop I could possibly find. I was actually amazed at how stupid easy it was to make money in this game. By the end it only took me a day or so to make enough money to buy Fairfax Castle. This is with no cheats. I also did not leave my character on all night to make the money roll in faster. A few days after getting the Castle I was back up to 2.5 million. That was with zero gold augments or any work at the bar or at the blacksmith shop.A couple days after beating the game I had pretty much purchased every single property you could possibly buy in the game (except for Temple of Shadows). I also went and shot down every single Gargoyle I could find and got the Legendary Crossbow in return. I found that many of the legendary weapons are a waste of time to bother finding.So now four days after I beat it, i'm running around to find things to do in the game. I was so bored that I killed everyone in town since I was so sick of being good the entire time. There's absolutely nothing fun left for me to do. Trying to get all the achivements is not my idea of fun. Sometimes i'll run through old dungeons just for fun, but some of them you can't access anymore unfortunately.To say the least, this game left a bad taste in my mouth. I'm kind of disgusted that the game was so short. I didn't feel like I rushed through it. The game could be easily beaten in one week of casual playing. The game is \"M\" rated, but it feels as if it was meant for children because the whole game feels like it's in Easy Mode. It's true that I'd prefer a game that's not super difficult, but this game is way too easy. It's not as if I used dozens of potions or an HP augment everywhere I went. I didn't even use any of the legendary weapons to beat the game. Even on the first trip into the Crucible I got perfect founds on all buy two. On the second try I got the Legendary Weapon.There are a few decent challenges in a few dungeons. I especially loved the ones where they seemed to throw dozens and dozens of enemies at you and you didn't think it'd ever end. There were a few where my fingers hurt from all the waves of enemies they sent at you. I don't remember which dungeon it was, but those were my favorites. I especially loved the Pirate Ship and the Charlie's Hat Quest. The biggest challenge for me was to get the Red Dragon pistol. I'm so terrible at manually targeting with the controller that I may never get it. My highest score has been only like 160 or something.The \"bosses\" in this game are a real joke. Sometimes I had no clue that whatever one I was fighting was actually the boss or not. I swear that one of them died in one head shot and I didn't even really get a good look at him. When I went to Wraith Marsh for the first time I figured the Banshees would be really difficult, but this definitely isn't the case. The only fairly difficult enemies in the game are the Spire Soldiers that throw spikes at you and some of the Trolls.For the price of this game, I just expect more for my money. I could have rented this game once or twice and finished it. I think I may just end up replaying the game over with a rusty weapon or something and see how that goes. I think Lionhead Studio owes us one by providing an update to add something in there to keep people playing. Hopefully in the next fable they will open up a difficulty option or at least have that be an option after you beat the game. What would be really nice is if they released a patch to allow all enemies to respawn, but that probably would never happen. Something to make everything more difficult.They just needed to come up with more dungeons in the game that offered a really big challenge.Believe it or not, in this game I got \"knocked down\" 3 times. The only time I remembered this happening was in the spire the second time around. No clue how that happened. It wasn't even at the boss fight.There's also quite a few bugs i've found, but most people will never experience any of them. My wife would randomly get scared of me for absolutely no reason and act like I was going to kill her. I also found my children talking around me about their dad, when I was standing right there. It's the same dialogue that other children in the area used as well. I also once stupidly moved my home to Brightwood Tower and both my children and wife would get lost. I'd try to find them for 15 minutes with no luck, but eventually did and had to move. Children in the game are the biggest annoyance to me. They all follow me around and always seem to say the same two things, mostly telling me to wait for them. I also really hated how every single woman in the game would walk into my house with hearts over their head. Using the dismiss motion didn't really seem to always help. I wish I could have just closed my door. Even when I wake up, they're just standing there! One last bug i've seen is one day I had \"Leave your house to exit Redecorate mode\" for like 4 hours on my screen! Even when changing areas it would not go away. I also found that if you have two of the same weapons with different augments, both get selected and only one of them will work correctly.Found the graphics pretty good, but I don't really play many other games to compare it with. The slowdown during menus is pretty annoying. I also hated how you're required to use the main menu way too much.One other negative about this game is that some things are useless in this game. Magic was rarely needed for me. Some people use it all the time, but not me. Only in the Crucible did I use it a lot. I also felt that with weapon augments, there was not a huge difference. I rarely noticed it. I don't have a clue why they didn't let you remove augments. I also hated how to find a good weapon with two augments you'd have to do a lot of running around. Shops and merchants often don't have them and it seems all random. One place that had them now doesn't. That merchant seems to have disappeared! Clothing Shops were nice to have in the game, but what's the point of it other than being able to customize it? How about armor with actual stats? I don't mean ones for your personality. Yes, I know that this game was never meant to be like Final Fantasy or World of Warcraft..Anyway, I did love this game, but it's way too short and way too easy. I just finished the game and just wanted more. I have no doubt that this game could be finished in under a few hours by someone that's beaten it a few times. I'm sure hoping that new expansion pack for this game will give me something more to do and keep me busy for at least a couple more days. If they release a Fable 3 I hope it's much longer, a bit more difficult, it's not rushed by Microsoft and they have more people working on it.\n",

      "First off, let me just say that I find negative reviews for this game completely laughable. The complaints I hear all seem to revolve around reading and waiting. Dear god say it aint so. I thought they made games for people who liked leveling up but hate reading and have no patience. Aren't they called God of War? Readers do not be put off by the negative things you have heard about this game but rather judge its merits on your own. Or better yet, my standards!  Wink!The storyline in this game runs deeper than almost any other I have ever seen in a game. At worst this game should warrant no less than a three, and this I say despite any personal taste, because you are expected to enjoy the genre you are reviewing otherwise you provide nothing useful, just as I would provide nothing useful if I reviewed a sports title. Some things are just good. Empire Strikes Back is just good. However, there is always someone who wants to be a contrarian, and then there are those with just plain awful taste. To those who can't handle this game's long build up, or as I like to call it \"Pacing\" (A concept few seem able to understand in our flash bang world today.)Perhaps you should master your adult onset ADD and give it another shot. Normally I would never criticize someone for their taste, but in this case it had to be said.This game is one that comes across every few years when the stars align (The real stars not the stars of destiny). It's not just a good RPG, it's not just a good game, it is just good! A quality piece of interactive media that creates an impression on those who can appreciate it! The tragedy of this game, and really the series in general is its puzzling lack of support and popularity despite its hardcore but small fan base. These games are very well made and fun to play, and yet they seem to be somewhat obscure in spite of this. If you are looking for a story that will give you that \"Oh my god Aeris noooooooo!\" feeling all over again, then this is the one.Plot and CharactersThe plot of this game is truly epic; so epic in fact, that there is nearly two hours of exposition involved before you begin to control your character, and can freely roam about. Is this a bit much? Yes, perhaps to some but I would argue that this set up is completely necessary. Suikoden games have always taken their time to get under way, but the pay off is a lushly fleshed out title, which makes you care about the characters, and what they are doing. The game sets its plot up not in a long winded way, but in a methodical careful way so that when the proverbial finally hits the fan, you are left drooling for more. You can expect all the same themes of intrigue, honor, betrayal, sacrifice, duty, and friendship that were present in the other games. I personally say this game is superior to the second title which is still considered the golden child of the series to many. I suspect a combination of nostalgia and rarity are all that places II above V, but that is not at all to say it is a bad game. They are both utterly fantastic in my eyes.You take on the role of a young prince in this game, who is caught up in the court intrigue and political maneuvering of his once prosperous kingdom. The game goes through great pains to introduce you to all the key players, rather than have them materialize in a big cape and say \"Ha ha ha I'm going to blow up the world!\" The characters, even the villains are complex, and you will really feel immersed in the court drama, and plotting that takes place in the game. I don't wish to give any more specifics for fear of spoiling the story, but after about 4 hours of ticking, this bomb explodes, and when it does you will not want to stop playing until you beat it.As for characters you are certain to find a few you like out of the 108 possible to recruit. This game has a long standing tradition of having the largest party both in battle and out of, for any RPG, and the large number is based around the story line itself. The 108 characters, including the main one correspond to the mystical 108 stars of destiny. Each person you bring on board has a special role to play, and recruiting them all makes up not only much of the content of the game but much of the fun as well. As in other games most characters won't throw their lot in with you until you perform a certain task. This aspect of the game requires much searching and backtracking to previously visited towns. You never know when a new face might show up. There are even a few reoccurring characters from other Suikoden games. If you have played through the others, and you should, you will be delighted to see these characters become playable once again.The main characters themselves are well designed, interesting and interact well with each other. So much of the story is conveyed through conversations between the main characters, and they are truly well crafted. This game is more reminiscent of a novel that was converted into a game in some ways. The characters personalities are replete with flaws, strengths and everything in between and even the \"bad guys\" of the game are extremely relatable.Game-play:Suikoden V does exactly what I want with a sequel to a beloved series of games. It preserves all the major elements of play, and adds in or combines a few extra bits as well. Unlike some series which feel the need to reinvent the wheel with each new title, (recent Final Fantasy offerings spring to mind) Suikoden has done a relatively good job of keeping its game mechanics integral. This game combines elements from previous games in a very effective way.There are three elements to the combat of the game. There is your basic 6 person party which constitutes most battles in the game. This is a fairly traditional turn based style of combat, but obviously having six characters instead of the typical three or four adds a new element to the flow. Then there is a one on one duel type battle, wherein you must preempt the actions of your opponent based on his or her words in order to effectively fight. Finally there are all out war segments, where members of your party lead units of soldiers, and act as generals. Each one requires a different type of strategy, and all are fun.Apart from this there are tons of mini games, and a nice customization element taken from Suikoden 3 and refined. The rune magic system offers a refreshing change from typical MP based magic in other games. The result is that you are able to cast magic less often, but it is far more powerful. I like this concept much more than the magic in other games which seems to have bright flashy graphics, but does barely more (or even less) damage than a melee attack from some spiky haired hotshot with a sword larger than his body.The game play overall is nice and solid. Nothing too difficult or too easy, and most of it revolves around strategy rather than button mashing or reflex. Moreover it is good because it offers that nostalgic experience to fans of the original two games. I am from the more traditional camp of RPG players, and it should be noted that I enjoy turn based strategy driven role playing games, much more than the more active type seen increasingly today. So if you started playing Role playing games recently you may find the slowness of this game off putting. I think it's minor and if you are invested for the right reasons you will hardly care about the combat system anyway. It may sound uppity but if you pass right over the wealth of great story and character interaction in this game and complain about the turn based battles, then you aren't a real RPG fan anyway in my book.Sound and GraphicsThe music in the Suikoden series is great! There is a very distinctly Asian sound to it but also a noticeable European influence. In fact the setting and graphics of the game are much the same. It's like a fusion of Japanese and European cultures, and it creates a subtle yet highly imaginative effect that is equal parts strange and appealing. The game is colorful, but not garish. Each character is rendered in a distinct fashion, and they have character portraits to show more detail. The cut scenes in the game are enjoyable, but perhaps a little awkward. There seems to be a lot of strange idiomatic hand waving that goes on for too long and other similar things. They aren't the best but they move the game along, and they aren't an unwelcome addition in any case.Graphically the game is not spectacular, but because of this more time could be spent making the game in depth in terms of plot, and it certainly has kept the game from being linear. Some titles have suffered for their primary emphasis on graphics, particularly in the PS2 area. This game looks good. It's not trying to be eyeball exploding. It doesn't want to be, or need to be. It's a classic styled game made specifically and unapologetically for fans of the series, and shows that this team of developers really understands what their fans want. Integrity!I'll wrap this up as it's already run a bit long. I can't say enough good things about this game. If you have played and enjoyed Suikoden I and or II then you must try this game. At the risk of sound sycophantic, it has it all. I am typically very harsh with games, as I have exacting standards for what I will call a good RPG, but I can scarcely think of a single negative comment about this game. I played once all the way through, and then literally restarted it and played through again before touching a single other game. I don't think there are any other games I can say that about.\n",

      "I had to write a review for this game because I read some of the negative reviews that it received. First of all, as a fan of The Godfather movies, I really enjoyed this game. It is an improvement over the original game. They fixed a lot of the problems from the first and made some tweaks to the game play. The game play is where this game shines.This game is in the vein of Grand Theft Auto and copies much of the ideas behind it so you will be deciding what to do, how to do it, and when. You actually get to be like the characters in the game. In that sense you are immersed in the Godfather universe.The game falls a bit on the easy side which is a good thing if you are buying this game for a someone who enjoyed the movie or the first game who is not a hard-core gamer. For someone like me, who is not a hard-core gamer, it is a good thing. I don't have the time to become one of those hard-core gamers mind you as I don't spend my days playing video games all day online or otherwise. I do have a life after all. You don't have to run through hoops to get to the next level. Some games can be too difficult and I have encountered my share of those but this one is just right.As far as the graphics are concerned, they are spectacular though not as detailed like let's say Call of Duty Modern Warfare. In my opinion that is one of the best games available but is on the very short side. I completed that game in roughly five hours. If you are mainly concerned with graphics then maybe you should get that game. But if you are looking for fun game play, look no further. The Godfather II has game play covered really well. This is where the game really shines. I found the game to be very engaging and kept me hooked for roughly ten hours which is about par for most video games. The fact that it got me playing it through to the end is an accomplishment in itself as many games do not keep you wanting to come back for more. This is not one of those games that will collect dust on the shelf. As far as replay value, I cannot say that I play a game over once I have completed it. Some people like to play a game over to get all the bonus items but I am not one of those.If you liked the movies and/or the first game, you should check this game out. Right now I notice that the price has been dropped significantly. I think this game is worth more than the price that it is going for right now. I suspect that this game has not sold like other blockbuster games because Electronic Arts did not do a good job of marketing it through the media. Marketing is very important and this game sadly did not get the attention it deserved. Most movie licensed games are not very good as they are basically made as a tie-in to make a quick buck but this one is one of the exceptions. If you were on the fence wondering whether to plunk your hard-earned money on this game, now is the time to get it as now the price is right. You can't go wrong with this game. This game warrants a four-star rating overall.\n",

      "Final Fantasy 13 is as you have obviously guessed the 13th iteration of the Final Fantasy Series. It sports it's own unique story line and a new combat system. This game has been mass marketed to the public and has boasted as the top selling Final Fantasy of all time. This is a grand statement as certain Final Fantasy's have reached to the point of cult followings in the terms of FFVII, FFVIII and FFX.Where to begin when talking about Final Fantasy 13... I had a lot of mixed emotions about this game at different points in time when I was playing it. The new tweaks to almost everything I found great and despicable at the same time throughout the game. Now I have been playing Final Fantasy since the 4th installment. I may have a bias view based upon some of the great memories I had with FFV, FFVI, FFVII, and FFVIII. Yet I was never truly disappointed in this game at all. I had a lot of fun playing it and I guess when it truly comes to a video game that is all that really matters.It is hard to do a review like I normally would by breaking down the categories into pros and cons on things that I thought were done well or sub-standard. I am not going to do that for this one as there were so many mixed feelings about this game the entire length of it. The game starts off in a firestorm of action. A mass cleansing of the world cocoon is under way. You control multiple different parties throughout the first couple of chapters. This leads to all the main characters meeting up and beginning the true adventure that the game is based around. The game attempts to keep the pace going that it started at for quite some time, and it is no issue early in the game that the path and movement is almost 100% linear. This pace ends up slowing and picking back up as the game continues and it fluctuates itself pretty well throughout the game leaving you at times to take a short hiatus from the frantic running in a straight line and battling, to sitting back and learning about the characters and the plot line a bit more in depth.The story line in this game is a real head scratcher in the beginning. You are simply running around killing anything that gets in your path to survival. This part of the game takes a little while to get rolling, and when it does it was a slight letdown. The story never gets that complex or interesting. It is mostly driven on by a couple of the key adult characters in the game, as they relentlessly push forward. Each event has its own kind of emotional touch to it and the characters react according to who they are trying to be and who they really are. Most of the story as well is not learned and progressively attained through the game via conversation or events in the game, it is a matter of opening the immense codex and reading all of the entries that are put into it over  time. It is a process that only true storytellers will want to take on. Now while the codex is not nearly as in depth as games such as Mass Effect or Dragon Age, it is still a big thing in the game and requires quite a bit of time in reading. You progressively learn about the culture of the world and the governments, as well as what factions, do what.The combat system has been revamped; it is a dynamic, turn-based experience. The characters on the screen move around on their own, but this movement is not controllable. Certain attacks take more, time to recover from and result in the battle having a sort of strategy that can reach deep into the game. However when selecting the attacks you wish to complete the battle is still raging on and is not plausible. This makes it a little hard to end up doing the real strategy that you want to do in an effective time frame. You do have the ability to auto-battle, but you might as well just have made it a movie since that sometimes seems to be the only way to win certain battles. Then you have the paradigms that are selected and changed in the middle of combat pretty easily. This changes what each of your characters do and allows you to mix and match roles that allow you to adapt to different situations. There are a multitude of different classes that can be chosen from, and certain characters excel at different ones. There is Commando, Ravager, Sentinel, Medic, Synergist, and Saboteur. Each has its own role in the course of the battles that you are going to be experiencing.My own experience with the battle system was interesting to say the least. There were times that I was cursing and screaming at the screen for the AI's stupidity in feeling the necessity to stand and bumb into one another as the enemy launched area attacks that ended up ravaging not only one of my characters but all of them. Needless to say this had gotten me the dreaded game over screen on more than one occasion. Then you have a silly little concept where you have to pick three members of the team and appoint a leader. You control none of your other team mates and they basically do whatever the Auto Battle option would pick. You control only the attacks of your main character, though you do get to choose the paradigms of all the characters. Then comes the bad part if one of the party members die then it is not a big deal but if the Leader gets slayed then it is an instant game over screen. So it has been a result of enemies just targeting my leader while my support cast just stands around like idiots. Then as they begin to get attacked they wonder over to my main character to get behind them and make them get hit with the attacks that were originally meant for them. It had points in time where it became a dark occurrence in battles where there was a sheer amount of assault meant to just cripple my main character. Although it had times where it was extremely fun and challenging, but not cheap as some AI likes to be. There were also many times where I casually went through the game only to find out I should have grinded a bit more in the previous area to be able to even stand a small chance against the next sections enemies.That brings me to the leveling system, or the Crystogenesis. This is a point based system that you get after defeating enemies. Then as you continue to get more you can utilize them on orbs within the Crystarium, the orbs offer different benefits such as HP boost, MP boost, Attack Power, and every other stat bonus in the game. Each Role (or paradigm) has its own circle and path to follow. After so many orbs are filled you reach new abilities and Level Ups in the Role. However not all Roles are built the same for every character. Each person has three main roles followed by non-proficient roles. Lightning for instance can gain orbs and Level Ups with the use of far, far, far fewer points in Commando, Ravager and Medic. The other paradigms take an exponential amount more points to even get an additional orb. So there only ends up being a very small amount of customization that can be done between characters, most have their assigned roles and are basically forced to stay with them. I however do understand this in an RPG as it adds a dimension to certain characters that is very dynamic to their personality.Which brings me to the weapon system that is crazily (in my opinion) flawed, you end up getting a few different weapons throughout the course of the game that are in the long run upgraded to the next level that is more powerful than the last. Each weapon as it is upgraded has its own set of unique characteristics that base the attack power or magic power of the weapon. This in itself helps limit the characters into what roles they are going to play throughout the game. It is very difficult for someone to just jump into the game and grasp exactly what they are doing. Since you need to spend item to upgrade them which is based off a point system as well, you end up using the very things you have to fight for to upgrade your weapons. At the end of fights you do not gain money either, and to buy anything at the very few shops that are available in the game you need to sell your items to obtain Gil(the currency of the game). So if you need items because you are weak then you have to sell the items that you would otherwise need to upgrade your weapons to make you more competitive against the monsters. As you can see it becomes highly flawed in the late early portions and doesn't ever really find its way back to fame. Getting everybody's ultimate weapon in the game I know is not supposed to be hard but not as hard as it ends up becoming; luckily though it is not needed for everyone to have them to defeat the secret hard bosses or the hardest enemies in the game.The graphics and sound in the game are just phenomenal though. There are a couple of times where the music was not up to par with the rest of the game but they still weren't that bad.Linear is the only word that needs to describe the pace of this game. It is 100% linear in almost every aspect. Eventually you get to a wide open area where you can run around and explore but this area pales in comparison to the world maps of old. Now I wasn't that displeased with how linear it was, although I felt like I might as well have been watching a movie and got to fight the battles. There are some points as well where you will watch a cut-scene and then it will take you back, then you run literally like 2 or 3 steps and it goes straight into another cut-scene. Why they didn't just tie them together is beyond me. I was however looking the whole game for something like a town that I could go around and accomplish something other than running in a straight line. However there is never a town in the game.Closing Thoughts: Final Fantasy 13 is by all means a good and fun game. Sure there are some points that are frustrating., and troubled, still these are sporadic and random at times. The good graphics make the game that much more immersive, and then the voice acting and music is great .Graphics: 8/10Sound: 8/10Gameplay: 7/10Replayability: 6/10 - There are side quests that can be completed after you beat the game.Story: 8/10Total: 37/50 - 7.4 Stars out of 10Rounding up to 4 out of 5 stars, because the game was fun.\n",

      "**Final update - early Feb 2014**I was curious after having happily sold this game a couple months ago to see what people are saying about it, so I decided to look at current reviews on here to see if any of the issues that made me hate the game and get rid of it were fixed.  All of the recent reviews on Amazon pretty much have the same short, vague, generic script.  They appear to me to be fake.  If you look at the profiles of the people, you can see they either copy-and-paste the same brief language on multiple products (ie, \"Bought this [insert type of product] for my son and he loves it...\" etc), or they only posted the one review for this game.  I have no idea how to report this to Amazon since I don't know if it violates any sort of terms of service or could even be remedied, but it is pretty messed-up since it defeats the entire purpose of allowing comments on a product.SO... all I can say is read the slightly longer reviews if you are interested in this game.  Maybe not mine because it is now novel-length, but basically I would suggest taking a random sampling of reviews for the game by looking at reviews with SPECIFICS as to why people liked or hated the game.  The game still sounds like it is not worth paying the price for.**End of final update, 1st update below*****1st Update 11/29/13**I sold Ghosts last week and it is gone from my home, for which I am happy, and I have deleted the information from my PS3 so zero space, physical or data, would be taken up further by this game. Do not buy this game for $60. I tried and tried to find a way to make this game fun, and just could not. I changed this game to 1-star overall too, since it is simply not a well-made (solid) game in terms of its basic game play.People can keep whacking my review here, but not even a \"COD fanboy\" should be supportive of this product, if anything they should be even more disappointed. Perhaps IW have since released enough patches for the game to make it is more fun then it was last week before I got rid of the game, but releasing an unprepared game itself is enough reason to not support a series further.Campaign mode was terrible for reasons I mentioned below (I did not bother finishing it), Extinction was immediately boring and made me miss the offline challenge modes from MW2 & MW3 even more, the free DLC map that came with ordering through Amazon did not work for online multiplayer with the main rotation, the online maps are at PS1 levels in terms of load times, even the bots which I thought MIGHT be the saving grace for a few more weeks of this game were difficult to kill since once again the screen just seems SO zoomed-out and hard to see guys.It is truly a remarkably crappy game considering it is a billion-dollar game, I think. And I am SURE they are well aware of it, and maybe like the big banks they just don't care since people will still buy it and sing the praises.This and Homefront are the two biggest wastes of money I feel I have ever spent on a major brand video game (or game with major advertising blitz) (since the PS1/N64 days). I have been playing FPS games since \"the old days\" (Wolfenstein on the computer, then Medal of Honor on PS1), so maybe a decade & a half now, and I realized the same thing as with Homefront: this was not fun. It was not a fun game. And a game that is not fun is not a game worth paying hard-earned money for.**End 1st Update, original review below**Original review:After having played a bit since its release date both offline campaign mode and online mode, I'm just already tired of this game and wish SINCERELY I had not spent $60 on it. It MIGHT be a fun-enough $20, I guess, but unless you are a diehard fan of the series, this is definitely not worth paying $60 for new, particularly if you are more of a casual gamer.My pros are: 1. the multiplayer maps look pretty and the height & added interactive map features of many of the levels are cool, 2. the player customization is cool.  That pretty much concludes my positive thoughts, unfortunately.Campaign:Call of Duty: Ghosts gets pretty much the same review as Homefront, which was the previous biggest video game ripoff I've played. It's generic now. It's been done.The offline campaign mode is all about its own premise, and that's it. It feels like you're battling against some ridiculous grouping of bad guys in a ridiculous way (oh no, a random South American allied group, because... N. Korea was already taken previously by Homefront as a good new enemy...?) and you're basically playing every level from every other game you've ever played in any other FPS game.It feels like these games are becoming more and more you are just a spectator, playing an interactive movie. That was my problem with COD MW3 - you just back off and let your squad do all the work, and it's not as though you have much of a choice. You get hit once by some random bullet you don't know where it came from, and you have to hide so you don't die, and then either it happens again once \"blood vision\" goes away, or your squad has all the fun for you and kills everyone. AND YOU GET HIT BY RANDOM BULLETS OFTEN, so you are thus having to HIDE often to keep from dying.And the amount of times my squad would get in my line of fire drove me CRAZY.  When I wanted to, you know, play the game, like, shoot the bad guys with my guns, my squad would run in front of me a lot of times, making me shoot them as well as the enemy.  More then a couple times did I get whatever the \"friendly fire will not be tolerated\" is screen.  That felt like Homefront-levels of AI poorness of quality.Getting repeatedly killed by sharks was both an extremely random addition to the game (though not as random as controlling Lassie) and really really irritating.  The prerequisite chopper and tank levels are also irritating and you can't wait until they're over.There are so many levels where they just kind of throw you at them, throw you into them, they last a few minutes, then they are over as quickly as they started, leaving you going, \"...ohhhhkayyy...that level happened and is now over...\"  You never fully get immersed into the game, and you end up feeling like you just want to play it to beat it so it's done and so you are then one thankful step closer to chalking the game up as a financial loss and pawning it/trading it in.Ultimately, like Homefront, the campaign mode is hard enough in the wrong ways that it is tedious and simply unsatisfactory.  The high point for me was probably the semi-stealth jungle portion, which lasted about ten minutes, but they were somewhat enjoyable ten minutes.  I just killed everybody.  It made it fun, I was in control of the game for that period without my AI fellas taking over and doing everything, and the enemy didn't automatically see me because I was, well, in the jungle.  But then I remember the shark part and go back to shaking my head and thinking about the $60+ I spent on this game again.Multiplayer (Online, ugh):The way they did the maps in multiplayer, it is like Battlefield in that... you cannot see your enemies. This game is far worse than any other I've played online in how you die extremely quickly. Half the time you never see the person who shoots you.  It seems like it is full of either snipers or stabbers.  I doubt it would be very hard for a first-time player to get 100 deaths in their first 8 times trying.The people who enjoy sprinting through levels stabbing are as always incredibly annoying - that is about as cocky as you can get, and seems like either a twisted way to approach a video game, or perhaps desperate I suppose if you're sick of getting quick-scoped. And Quickscopers in this game... ugh.  You just see a person and you die.  It's just not that fun.  It is WAY too easy to die in this game (that goes for campaign mode too).  \"Realism\" should always be balanced with FUN in video games, with fun always being the key goal.  And frankly many of the kills I have gotten have been by me spawning behind someone who obviously has no idea I am suddenly there.  It's not a satisfactory way of killing someone, but then you figure it happens to you every other time so whatever.  Ugh.I find myself \"rage-quitting\" often, because this is a VIDEO GAME and I bought it TO HAVE FUN, not to constantly get screwed.  They MUST make these games for people who are more CASUAL gamers too, besides people who apparently have the time to just do nothing but play these video games online for hours and days at a time. Seeing some of the score and point skews of the winners is pretty pathetic.  I'm sure people cheat with this game, but who knows how, and who has the time or energy to really investigate much further, other than to just report sociopathic people (why else cheat, and then try to justify it and make it the problem of those who play honestly, as all cheaters do?) who are clearly too good, of cheating.If you are a casual gamer, like you just like to play every few evenings a week for a couple hours, you will not enjoy this game for its multiplayer - do not spend $60 on this game.  It's been literally just one week since the game was released and there are already players at the very least at Level 58 that I have seen.Multiplayer (split screen, boo!):One of the biggest disappointments of all to me personally, is that they got rid of the offline multiplayer challenge modes that made COD MW2 and 3 so fun and re-playable for those of us with actual friends in the real world we like to hang out with and play these games with. Instead they brought in some zombie-like alien mode that I have not yet tried because what is the point.  Playing next to a friend the screen feels like it's zoomed-out somehow, maybe because it's more stretched wide, where it is just more difficult to see.Further thoughts/rants:I don't know if it's the developers or who, but this game is another over-priced disappointment, for me the biggest one since Homefront. The graphics do not seem that impressive, everything else is pretty unoriginal, and online play is pretty bad unless you have some mega-100\" giant screen or I guess are a person who gets to just play all day and is on high volumes of caffeine or something.Angry review. I won't give this one star, because it has enough different things that you can play through and it is a way to spend time, though not perhaps the best way to spend time.  And for those people who may read this review and say the game is NOT for \"casual gamers,\" so why I am knocking it so much, I paid the $60 for it like you did, so the game is just as much for me as it is for you.Bottom-line:Not worth the money at $60. I would not be happy with having spent anything more than $30 on this game.  It's fun in that: it's a new COD game. That is all. Nothing more. At all. This was not a step in the right direction, other than the size of the maps online and the player customization. The size of the maps online are great. Except you can't see who is killing you.As always, I don't care what series a game is, I have pretty much tried them all, owned a few, and I only have loyalty to whether a game is fun or not, and worth spending the cost at the time.  I realize I pretty much just make fun of this game a lot here and do knock it heavily, but it is with disappointment and frustration that I do so.  I would have much preferred the game being fun, re-playable, and worth having dropped $60+, and it was just not much of any of those things.  This game is pretty bad.  And that is pretty disappointing.  It feels like a prettier version of Homefront, with some elements (and levels) \"borrowed\" from GoldenEye Reloaded.  It will, once again, make me think twice about purchasing games brand new.\n",

      "Mega Man 2is generally considered the breakout game for our titular blue bomber, and for good reason: it fixed all the problems found in the firstMega Man, and was one of the best games for the NES.  Truthfully, it's the only \"Mega Man\" game I had for the NES in the late 1980s and early 1990s, though I played the first game quite a bit as well.  As good as \"Mega Man II\" is, is it really the best Mega Man game ever, let alone in the classic series?If it weren't for \"Mega Man III\", I would unequivocally say yes.  \"Mega Man III\" is easily as good as \"Mega Man II:, and opens up the Mega Man gameplay, expanding Mega Man's repertoire.Major new features introduced in \"Mega Man III\"*Slide - Mega Man can now slide, creating new possibilities for level design.*You can now carry up to 9 energy tanks, rather than 4 like \"Mega Man II\"*Due to the introduction of the Doc Robot levels, this is by far the longest of the six NES \"Mega Man\" games.*Rush, Mega Man's iconic robotic dog, makes his debut here.*Proto Man, masquarding as the mysterious Break Man, debuts as well.*Another notable feature is this is the first game that has accurate cover art on how Mega Man actually appears in the game.  \"Mega Man\" is notoriously bad cover art, and \"Mega Man II\"'s cover art has Mega Man holding a gun rather than his arm cannon.  Not bad but not great. This is definitely an improvement over the last two.\"Mega Man III\" actually has the best story of all six NES titles.  Dr. Light and Dr. Wily are working together to build a giant peace keeping robot named Gamma.  However, the eight robot masters that the two designed to help keep the peace go beserk, stealing 8 power crystals.  The two scientists quickly call Mega Man into action.Mega Man must defeat the eight bosses to regain the crystals.  This set of levels is probably my favorite in any Mega Man game.  They're all very well designed, and just flat-out fun to play.  The Shadow Man level and Snake Man level are both great.But wait, there's more.  After defeating the eight robot masters, four new levels open up (they are remixed or altnerate versions of four regular levels), and robot masters named Doc Robots are masters of these levels.  There are two Doc Robots per level.  While all the Doc Robots look the same, they are actually programmed to act like one of the robot masters in MEGA MAN II.  When you reach the Doc Robot's lair, the sprite of one of the \"Mega Man II bosses descends from top of the screen down into Doc Robot, like the spirit of that perspective boss is inhabiting or animating the Doc Robot's body.Once you defeat the 8 Doc Robot masters, another level opens in the center of the portrait page, entitled BreakMan.  It is a simple one screen level, where you must fight ProtoMan.  Ultimately, it is revealed Proto Man is Mega Man's brother, and built before Mega Man.  Proto Man, who has been kept ambigious throughout the game, has been helping train Mega Man with each fight.After you finish your training level with Proto Man, you now learn that Dr. Wily has stolen the power crystals Mega Man recovered, and has holed up in a new Skull Castle, intent on activating Gamma and reprogramming him to begin yet another attempt to take over the world via thru the campaign of bloody massacre or pogrom.Wily's Castle features several cameos or references to the first two games.*The famous Rock Monster (AKA the Yellow Devil) from the first game makes a return appearance, with a newly designed appearance.*Gamma looks a lot like Gutsman (who, of all the villains in Mega Man, makes the most cameo appearances in other games, his likeness also appears as a Wiley Castle Boss in \"Mega Man III\").*The boss guarding the transporter room in the fourth portion of Dr Wily throws rocks like Gutsman.*Mega Man must fight his clone, just like the original \"Mega Man\".  This  time around, there are three platforms, each with a separate clone.  One clone is real, the other two holograms, and the real clone's location constantly changes between the three platforms.The Dr. Wily stages are fun, although the last incarnation of Dr. Wily is the weakest of all six NES Wily bosses.  With a single top spin, you destroy him.The only two negative things I have to say about the game is this: the story is not really explained, and the inclusion of Top Man.1.  The story is the best in the NES Mega Man Games.  With the other titles, you are given some cut scenes to tell what little story there is.  In \"Mega Man III\", there are no cut scenes initially, so you don't really know the story.  In fact, until you defeat BreakMan and the Dr Wily stage opens up (the Dr Wily levels is proceeded by a cut scene with Dr. Light and Mega Man, revealing Dr Wily is evil), you probably won't even now Dr Wily is supposed to be helping you.  Granted, the game is longer than the other titles, so maybe they didn't have the memory to work with on extra cut scenes, given the NES's technical limitations.  Still, given how it's the best story it's sad Capcom relied almost entirely on the game manual, which most NES players won't have access too, to advance the story.2. Top Man.  He's the most stupid robot master of the first three games, and his weapon is hard to figure out how to use.  Once you do figure it out, its pretty useless with the sole exception of the last boss fight.  The whole idea of \"Top Man\" as a robot master is pretty ridiculous, and is the first indication in the Classic Series that Capcom is beginning to run out of ideas for robot masters.  This trend of borderline asinine robot masters would continue thru \"Mega Man IV\" and \"Mega Man 5\", and reach the absolute bottom of the barrel in \"Mega Man 6\"(really, who the HELL thought of \"Plant Man\"?)  A minor quibble, though, and don't let that distract you from all the game has to offer.  It's a more important as an indicator of bad things to come for the series than really effecting this game's quality.  Beginning cracks in the foundation, if you will.Overall, I think this is easily one of Mega Man's best games, and is an essential purchase for NES and retro gamers, as well as Mega Man fans.  As much as I like \"Mega Man II\", I really think \"Mega Man III\" gives it a run for its money.Though \"Mega Man II\" is more important from a franchise historical pov as it was his first major hit game (\"Mega Man\" was more of a sleeper hit), \"Mega Man III\" takes everything about \"Mega Man II\" and improves on it.  This one definitely ups the ante, and the next three sequels simply can't compare it its genius or playability.\n",

      "It's hard to believe, but the Mega Man series has been around for approximately 15 years. Within that time span, the core mechanics of the series have remained largely unchanged, though Capcom has admittedly attempted to deviate from the path with recent releases in the EXE series and, to a lesser extent, the Zero series. However, the latest release in the Mega Man series, Mega Man &amp; Bass, doesn't do anything drastically different to make itself stand out from other games in the series. In fact, anyone craving some old-style, surprisingly difficult Mega Man action shouldn't think twice before jumping right into Mega Man &amp; Bass. Mega Man and Bass have different skills. For those who are unaware, Mega Man &amp; Bass was one of the few Mega Man games for the Super Famicom that was never released in North America. The game lets you play as either Mega Man or his sinister-looking cohort, Bass, both of whom have different abilities that affect the way you play the game. Mega Man has all of his traditional attacks, such as his buster shot (which he can also charge up) and the slide, but Bass is a little more dynamic, with his ability to rapid-fire in any direction and to perform double jumps, a skill that becomes invaluable in later parts of the game. Both characters can absorb a boss's weapon, but unfortunately, these weapons function similarly for both Mega Man and Bass. It's also worth noting that Mega Man's default weapon is a little stronger than Bass', which is meant to compensate for Mega Man's inability to use rapid fire.Interestingly, many of the levels and even some of the boss fights in the game seem to be primarily designed for Bass and his specific skills, or at least they're a little bit easier when playing as Bass. As previously mentioned, Bass' double jump is quite useful. It helps you bypass certain obstacles--such as the annoying disappearing-reappearing block puzzles from Mega Man 2 that appear in the game--which Mega Man would have to confront head-on. Of course, Mega Man has his own advantages. He can slide into small areas that usually contain health and, in some cases, into areas that Bass cannot reach, but these aren't as abundant as you might think. Whether you're playing as Mega Man or Bass you'll find that the game, or more specifically the boss battles, can be fiendishly difficult. In most Mega Man games, you can learn the attack pattern of an individual boss and adjust your strategy accordingly, but in Mega Man &amp; Bass, the bosses have so many different attacks that it can be difficult to gauge what they're going to do next. It can be frustrating to encounter a boss only to lose all your lives and have to start over at the beginning of the level, but since the levels are relatively short, it's not a huge pain to go back through them repeatedly. The fact that the game automatically saves at certain points in a level makes this more bearable. There are a few other differences between Mega Man &amp; Bass and most of the other games in the Mega Man series. Instead of selecting any level at the beginning of the game, you'll only be able to select from three--you can select other stages after beating the first three bosses. In addition, Mega Man &amp; Bass features a shop system where you can buy power-ups for either character, including additional lives, health, or armor that reduces spike damage. Only a few of these items are truly useful, but there is quite a selection to choose from. Lastly, there's a library in the game where you can unlock information on dozens of Mega Man characters by finding CDs that are spread across each level, some of which are precariously dangled over spikes and other such hazards. As with most ports from the Super Nintendo to the Game Boy Advance, the graphics in Mega Man &amp; Bass appear to be unchanged from those in the Super Nintendo game. Most of the sprites in the game are quite large and vivid, and they animate well. Even the traditional helmet-wearing enemies from previous Mega Man games have a surprising amount of detail in their walking animation. There are also some nice little touches. When Mega Man or Bass are dangerously low on health, their idle animation will indicate that. Unfortunately, some of the backgrounds can be a little bland at times, but you'll have little time to pay attention to them anyway. These are some of the toughest bosses in any Mega Man game to date. The music in Mega Man &amp; Bass is successful in capturing the theme of each level, but there aren't any tracks that particularly stand out. The music quality also varies--some tracks sound as though they were produced on Game Boy sound hardware, while others are definitely Super Famicom quality. All of the sound effects have been reused from previous Mega Man games, particularly the noise that Mega Man and Bass make after landing a jump, which you'll hear quite often. There's nothing particularly special about Mega Man &amp; Bass other than the fact that it lets you play as two characters with different abilities that can actually make the game more difficult or less difficult. As such, if you're looking for a straightforward Mega Man action game, you really can't go wrong with Mega Man &amp; Bass, but if you're looking for a game that puts more spin on the traditional Mega Man recipe, you might want to try out the Mega Man Zero games or the Mega Man EXE games.\n",

      "Mega Man might be old, but he's one tough little midget. Back in his heyday, he ran through a gauntlet of action platformers, foiling the ever-nefarious Dr. Wily and his band of unique henchmen over and over again. Unfortunately, there was one recurring frustration with Mega Man: his adventures had become too repetitive, each new game simply a mirror of the last.In an ironic effort to keep the fading series fresh, Mega Man is constantly being re-imagined. Over the past few years, we've seen Mega Man X, Mega Man Legends, Mega Man EXE, Mega Man Zero, Mega Man Soccer, and coming soon, a Mega Man RPG. Cripes! All this for a robot-kid who didn't learn how to duck until Mega Man X5, some 20 games into the series? Rather than keep us interested, this overbearing diversity is enough to make us long for the simple action of the original games.But have heart, young gunners - Mega Man Anniversary Collection hops aboard the time travel express and offers a nostalgic trip back to the classic Mega Man games. Newcomers might not get misty-eyed, but even they can't argue with the value-minded price. The collection includes all the classic games, Mega Man 1 through Mega Man 8, plus two average fighting games never before released in the U.S.For newbies who don't know much about the series, Mega Man is a blue robot with a heart of gold. In Japan, his name was Rock Man. His sister robot was named Roll. Rock and Roll. Oh, the wit.Anyway, Mega Man repeatedly fights against Dr. Wily, a crazed inventor who fashions eight evil robots of various talents. By beating these robots, Mega Man earns their weaponry, each of which is effective against some other major baddie. Eventually, Mega Man throws down against Wily in the evil scientist's skull fortress. Wily gets whooped, promises to always be good, brush his teeth, and never again wrong the world'and five seconds later, he does it again.The good news is that there are no emulation problems in this collection - expect perfect 8-, 16- and 32-bit recreations all the way. You jump, you shoot, you gain new abilities, you jump and shoot some more. The games play just as they did originally, which means they're still hard, fun and classic.That being said, some of the games are better than others. The original Mega Man was difficult and not particularly fun, and the same holds true today. Things pick up in Mega Man 2, 3 and 4, where the series truly found its groove and defined itself as a top-notch platformer.Much of that has to do with the robots. Some of them look sharp, like the wicked Pharaoh Man and Snake Man, while others look improbably ridiculous, like the moronic Clown Man. As is usually the case with a series that has stuck around a little too long, the designs get less original and more far fetched as the years pass. The best robot designs, unsurprisingly, are in Mega Man 2, 3, and 4. With each new iteration, you can see Dr. Wily losing it more and more. Flower Man? Top Man? Wily, please.Really only a few changes have been made to the games and they're very minor. The Navi remix mode that first appeared in Mega Man 8 is now in every game, which overlays intermittent, non-invasive directional arrows to help keep you from going the wrong way. Navi mode also replaces the original 8-bit midi tracks with actual instruments. The 8-bit versions still sound more fitting, but the remixes certainly aren't a problem.A new quicksave memory card system has been grafted over the old password system, allowing easy automatic saves instead of the tedium of writing down all the grid information. Purists can still enter in the old passwords or start over if they die, however.The interface wrapping everything together is kind of neat as well; instead of a normal menu, Mega Man runs through doors marked with the various games and options. While superficially clever, much more could have been done with this. Why not a museum for Mega Man to wander through?It's a little hard to quibble about \"extras' in a collection of this size, however. Mega Man Anniversary Collection does include plenty of art and audio to unlock as well as the two unreleased fighting games, both of which are pretty bad. The PS2 also enjoys a Mega Man cartoon episode.For $30, there's no cheaper way to re-experience Capcom's mega-past. Though the series is pretty much stale these days, that wasn't always the case, and the Mega Man Anniversary Collection serves as a reminder that while the games might feel a little dated, the Blue Bomber still has some fight left.\n",

      "By the time Capcom released MEGA MAN VI on the NES, it was obvious to all in the industry that Nintendo's 8-Bit console, the machine that resurrected the video game market in the mid 1980s to the multibillion dollar industry that it is now, was on its last legs.  Capcom wanted to move Mega Man to the SNES, but before doing so, they made a final chapter for everyone's favorite blue bomber.Ironically enough, Capcom chose not to release MEGA MAN VI in the United States, publishing the game only in Japan, due to their decision to put their efforts behind the new MEGA MAN X series.  When Capcom informed Nintendo of this decision, Nintendo took it upon themselves to publish the game in America, which is why the game was never released in Europe.How does it stand up to the other five games?  Actually, not that bad.  It's obvious Capcom is running out of ideas.  The basic story is that a mysterious Mr. X (gee, I wonder who that could be) has been setting up a robot tournament, and when Mega Man shows up, all the robots turn against Mega Man and Mr X tries to take over the world.  Naturally, when you defeat Mr X, turns out it is Dr. Wiley and you have to go into a second castle.  While Mega Man IV and V at least at an element of surprise in their \"twist\" ending, by VI you can tell it's Wiley from the beginning, even kinda looks like him.First off, the graphics are top notch, and so is the sound.  But that is little surprise as Mega Man always had great graphics for the NES.Capcom was so bereft of ideas They even had contestant winners in Nintendo Power design two of the robot bosses (Wind Man, designed by Michael Leader of the US, and Knight Man, designed by Daniel Vallie of Canada).The other six bosses are largely retreads of previous robot masters or just plain ridiculous.We have Plant Man (who, might I add, is the single worst boss in not only Mega Man, but in all of video games - he's just gay).  His (lame) weapon is a flower shield, and basically he's a poor boy version of the superior Leaf Man from MEGA MAN II.  We have Blizzard Man, who for whatever reason is on skis.  Ripoff of Air Man from II and Ice Man from the first game.  Flame Man is yet another heat-based robot master (we've already had Fire Man from I, Heat Man from II, and Napalm Man from V).  We have Tomahawk Man, who is very formidable, but still feels out of place and like Capcom was really stretching for ideas.  Centaur Man is at least somewhat imaginative. The worst, though, is Yamato Man.  Apparently Yamato is a geographical term in Japan.  It'd be like Oxford Man or Birmingshire Man or Las Vegas Man.  Incomprehensible.  Stupid.  Even Wind Man, who was designed by one of the contestant winners, is little more than another version of Air Man.The levels themselves, while compentant, are hardly what you call inspired.  A lot of them you have seen before in previous incarnations, especially Flame Man's level (come on, we've had fire-themed levels before).A bad part of the levels is that four of them have false endings, I guess in attempts from Capcom to give the game more replayability. In each of the levels for Tomahawk Man, Yamato Man, Knight Man, and Centaur Man, two separate boss chambers appear, one more difficult to reach than the other.  By accessing the more difficult of the two you get one of four letters (B, E, A, T), and when you get all four you can now use Beat, the robotic bird from Mega Man V.  Quite frankly, the fake endings are rather dumb.The last levels have some engaging moments, even though one of the castle bosses (a big dragon) is a little too similar too the boss dragon of Mega Man II for my comfort.  There's another stage in the Wiley's castle which is primarily dirty water and those spiked orbs, which is again a throw back to Mega Man II.The end features Dr Wiley being thrown in jail, with the last words and a newspaper picture printed.  The ending provides good closure for the series, but then Capcom spoils that by saying \"To be continued\".  Still a good way to close the NES leg of Mega Man's journey as far as story-wise goes.Mega Man also has some new features.  Taking a page from Mario, he has a rush adapter that allows him to fly (albeit, pretty briefly).  This is featured prominently on the game art.  Beat returns.  I would like to have flown longer, given how much this was hyped.Is MEGA MAN VI a good game? Yes.  Without a doubt.  It would be an even better game its five predecessors did not exist.  Because ultimately, even though they tried adding some new things to the Mega Man formula, at the end of the day, Capcom with this title feels tired and uninspired, like they trying to squeeze one more dollar out of the Mega Man franchise.  But that's largely because MEGA MAN VI is just more of the same.  If you like the formula you'll love this title.  But it is still very formulaic.All the NES Mega Man games are good, but they're largely the same.  I'd go with II or III first, but if you haven't played any Mega Man games VI is a good place to start.  But II and III should be your first choice.\n",

      "In the late 80's, Nintendo ruled the world with its NES. Countless games had been released and created many memories for gamers around the world. The Mega Man series were running full steam thanks to the underground buzz of Mega Man and the breakout success of Mega Man 2. Revered for the classic shoot and jump game play, memorable Robot Masters and awesome music, the games were a joy to play through and Capcom had to keep up with the demand for more Mega Man games. After releasing a Mega Man title for the Game Boy, they headed back to the drawing board for 1990's Mega Man 3. It was at that point that many felt (including myself) the NES Mega Man series reached the highest point.The story for Mega Man 3 goes like this: After being defeated twice, Dr. Wily decides to be a good guy and help Dr. Light create a new peace keeping robot for their world. In order for it to be fully powered, they send Mega Man to get energy crystals. Just as he leaves for his journey, robots go crazy and threaten to halt the introduction of the new robot. Now, Mega Man had to get the energy crystals and find out why the robots went crazy. Of course, in the end, Dr. Wily was behind the commotion and stole the robot so he can use it to take over the world. Surely, Mega Man stopped him......and found out that he had a brother, Proto Man.The premise of Mega Man 3 is the same as the previous two entries: Choose one stage out of eight stages filled with enemies and a Robot Master. Get the special weapons from all Robot Masters by completing all eight stages. Next, you moved on to the next set of stages (four \"Doc Robot\" levels where you face off against robots \"possessed\" by the spirits of the Robot Masters from Mega Man 2.) Finally, after you clear one extra stage, you reach Dr. Wily's castle and this time it was made up of six stages. By the time you beat the game, you would have played through 19 stages, the most in a Mega Man game out of the entire NES series. There were new additions first introduced to the NES Mega Man series: the ability to slide through narrow gaps between walls, Mega Man's new sidekick (Rush the robot dog) who came with his own adapters that transformed him into various objects, the ability to save up to nine energy tanks and Proto Man, Mega Man's brother who first appeared in disguise as Break Man to test Mega Man. The password system returned to help save your progress so you can continue your game later.The PROS: Mega Man 3 perfected everything that the Mega Man games were known for: a good story, excellent graphics, superb music, good sound effects, perfect controls and a difficulty level that wasn't too easy nor was it too overbearing. Capcom hit all the right notes with new Robot Masters (for the first time one of them was based on an animal, portraying a hint of what has yet to come), new stage layouts, appearances from Mega Man 2's Robot Masters, new abilities, new characters and the longest Mega Man game to grace the NES.The CONS: While it was mentioned in the story, you never ever picked up the energy crystals so it was kind of weird. Some gamers noticed that with this game, the Robot Masters were more prone to receive damage because they didn't have a grace period between hits. This was weird to see but it was just a small fraction against the game since you still had to memorize the robot's attack pattern and avoid touching it.Many gamers agreed that Mega Man 3 was another fun game to play starring the Blue Bomber. It sold very well and ensured that we would see him again. There are good reasons that Mega Man 3 in particular was and is still fondly remembered. All you have to do is play the game. For Mega Man fans, it was awesome. If you weren't a fan by the time it was released, then this game wouldn't sway your opinion. For those who missed out on any of the NES games, you did miss out. Get yourself a copy of this game through any of these methods: the actual cartridge, the Mega Man Anniversary Collection disk (PS2 or GC) or download this game for the Wii from the Virtual Console Cartridge for US $5.00 (500 points.) Any way you choose is worth it. I highly recommend it.\n",

      "This mouse looks much nicer when seen in real life than it does when seen in the point of sale photographs.  In the promotional photos, they spent a lot of time getting cool lighting and a nice 3d effect but in my opinion the mouse looks bright, edgy and over saturated.  When you see the mouse in person in normal lighting it looks much classier and less over-designed. My husband commented on this too so I attached a photo with the review.The mouse comes in a hefty box, a simple manual and CD rom containing the mouse profiling software that allows you to create custom macros to use with your games and with a nice selection of useful ones for popular productivity software like MS Office.The mouse is designed to be ambidextrous so it isn&#8217;t quite as comfortable as some I have used. I&#8217;ve used a Logitech G500 gaming mouse for a year or so and it is slightly more comfortable and has similar specks For left-handed or ambidextrous gamers, this mouse is a little smaller than some of the competition and is flared at the bottom on both sides to hold the sides of your hands above your mouse pad. The mouse arch is quite high for your pinky and thumb to rest easily on the flared bottom.The mouse has six buttons, though they are pretty regular. There is the standard left and right mouse button and scroll wheel button most mice come with. There is a button on either side that, by default, has forwards and backwards macros for web browsing and a button in the center that, by default, sets the DPI resolution of the mouse.If you&#8217;re new to mice with configurable DPI, this one has five settings and basically they change the speed the mouse tracks across the screen when you move it. With the center DPI button you can quickly switch resolution so lowest for small movements with great accuracy like sniping, and high for quick movements like spinning around in an FPS or RPG. Depending on the type of game, either can be useful. This is also the sixth button which can also be edited in the provided software.The cord is a decent length and has a cloth braided covering for extra strength and rigitidty. It has a Velcro strap should you need to gather up the cable and tie it for storage or travel. The extra LED light in the mouse is a pleasant red and has several settings for pulsating or solid. The LED lights the GX logo and the red band on the mouse wheel while the sides of the mouse have metallic stripe accents that match the LED quite nicely for a pleasing aesthetic.The mouse also has metal weight inside and as a result weighs approximately the same as my G500 weighted mouse with all the weights inside. So it doesn&#8217;t feel cheap. The buttons are all very precise, the mouse wheel is of the notchy variety but feels solid. The wheel and the sides of the mouse are rubberized for good grip.The one downside initially is that the pads under the mouse that make contact with the surface you drag the mouse over have a very fine texture and are not smooth like I am used to. As a result, this mouse doesn&#8217;t glide quite as well as my old one. One very nice thing is that it comes with a spare set of feet should the first wear out. I expect in time the feet will wear to a smooth polished finish and glide as well as my G500 mouse. The mouse has one of the latest sensors with great precision.Build quality overall is very good. It feels solid, seems to be made of quality components and seems very reasonably priced for what you get.If I were going to fault the mouse it would be because I feel that the sixth button for setting DPI by default is disappointing. Five-button mice are pretty common, and the location of this sixth button on top center is not easily reached in the heat of game action. So it isn&#8217;t that useful.  I&#8217;d have liked one extra button on the left side so that you have two you can reach with your thumb.I like this mouse overall currently use it to play War Thunder, a flight simulator.  In that game, I primarily use a flight stick in my right hand and the GX Gaming mouse in my left. My previous G500 gaming mouse is designed for right handed use and could not be used this way. While the Genius mouse can be used in either hand and works well.\n",

      "I got this mouse because I wanted a gaming mouse to go with my new gaming keyboard, the Razer Blackwidow Ultimate. Since the keyboard was by Razer, I decided to try a Razer mouse. I settled in on this one because it had the right balance of price and functionality. I was previously using the Logitech M500 mouse, a great mouse but not a gaming mouse. After learning about all the features of this mouse and experimenting with the settings, I can see where this mouse has huge potential for a wide variety of uses. The mouse frustrated me at first, but as I learned more about it my experience and satisfaction with it grew.This mouse is very comfortable in my hand. I use more of a palm/flat style to hold my mouse, and this works well with the shape of the Deathadder. Users who are more claw-style holders may have more of a challenge with this than palm-style users (google mouse grip styles for more information). I like the light-up scroll wheel on the top of the mouse, and the side buttons are nice and large, so they are easy to press. They are also noticeably more smoother than the buttons on the Logitech M500, which are stiffer to press down. The light-up scroll wheel is cool, also the light-up Razer logo on the body of the mouse is a nice 1337 touch. The Deathadder has a braided USB cable and a gold connector to reduce latency. The top of the mouse is made out of a neat rubbery material that has a nice, smooth feeling. Like the other reviewers said, the sides of the mouse and the two side buttons have a shiny plastic finish that can attract finger grease, but I don't mind wiping it off every now and then. The feet of the Deathadder are made of a Teflon material that makes the mouse literally glide across your mousepad! This helps the sensitivity of the mouse and makes its movements smooth.The mouse does come with a bit of a learning curve if you are not used to gaming mice. The Deathadder will work fine with no drivers out of the box, but in order to get the full range of options available you need to go to Razer's website and download the drivers for the mouse. There is also a firmware update there as well. Navigating the Razer website for the correct drivers leaves much to be desired. It is a little tricky to find the correct drivers but after that, installing them is no problem. Once the drivers are installed and you restart, then you have access to the full configuration options for the mouse. This is where things can get a little confusing if you are new to the world of gaming mice.The driver software is not very visually appealing at all--the font is small, boxy, and the whole interface is a very dark and more than a little cramped. But beneath the ugly exterior of the driver software lies the mouse's true potential. Don't get discouraged here. If you take the time to learn what each of the configuration options means, you will find that the mouse has a lot of power in it. I initially did not like the mouse and was getting ready to return it to Amazon because it skipped around on my computer screen a lot (and I did remove the film from the bottom). I couldn't understand why the mouse would not work smoothly, but after I educated myself I found out that the polling rate on the mouse defaulted to 500Mhz, but the normal rate for most mice was 125Mhz. Also, the two USB ports on my computer that were reserved for the keyboard and mouse were USB 1.1. Combined, those two things accounted for the mouse skipping. I created a profile for the mouse with a polling rate of 125Mhz, and adjusted the sensitivity and the acceleration of the mouse, and the skipping problem went away. I also created a faster profile for when I am gaming.Again, this mouse does take a learning curve as far as the configuration goes if you are not into gaming mice. Please don't give up on the mouse until you have put the time it to learn about all the setting options and how they work together. I would have sent back a perfectly fine mouse if I had went with my initial feelings about it. Now I love the fact that this mouse can accommodate a wide variety of uses, from gaming, to everyday web browsing, to even photo editing (with the high DPI settings)! The only two features that this mouse doesn't have that I miss are horizontal scrolling and hyper-scrolling (like my M500). Still, I do give the scroll wheel on this mouse its credit as the clicks on the scroll wheel of the M500 were not as defined due to the unlocking feature of the mouse. Also, on the M500, using the mouse as a button was tricky because actually pushing down the scroll wheel required much more force and was not nearly as crisp as the Deathadder.I am now very happy that I did get this mouse. This was a good place for me to start learning how to improve my game with gaming mice. If you are looking for a mid-range gaming mouse that has some premium features but doesn't break the bank, this is the mouse for you. Just be sure to learn how to use it to its full potential.\n",

      "Update (1-19-14): Now that I've had this mouse for a couple of years, I can better judge the product as a whole.  While this mouse is still a great performing mouse, I find that it often double clicks on the left button when you only press it once.  This seems to be an issue with many of these mice.  It only occurs avery so often but it does happen at least a few times a day.  It can be annoying because it will click twice when you only need to click once.  I lowered the stars to 3 because of this as it can be devastating it a double click were to happen during a financial transaction or something of that sort.  This also applies to gaming as well.  It will shoot a gun twice rather than just once in FPS's.  It seems that there is a new model of this mouse out now so perhaps they have fixed this problem in the new model.  I may eventually sell this mouse and get the newer model but I will use this mouse for now as it is still not too bad.Update (1-1-13): Now that I have had considerable time to use the mouse, I have a better opinion of quality and performance.  In a nutshell, this mouse is just amazing.  It is so smooth and precise.  I use the mouse on the best DPI/polling rate settings.  I also have this plugged into a USB 3.0 port in the back of my PC, although I doubt that it matters but you never know.  The mouse fits well in the hand and glides smoothly over my SteelSeries Mass Qck pad (The thick/smaller cloth one).  I have received many compliments on how the mouse looks and performs over the past several months.  I'll just end this update to this review by saying that I do recommend this mouse, especially if you want a mouse that feels great, looks great, and performs with top precision in anything and everything you do on the computer.Okay, so first off, I want to point out that I have only had this mouse for about 5 days of this writing.  At this point, I would consider this as just impressions of the device since I have not used it much.This mouse looks awesome.  The blue LEDs of the scroll wheel and the logo on the back make this mouse stand out on my desktop.  The top part of the mouse has a nice rubberized texture that really helps in terms of control while using it.  There are two buttons on the left side of the mouse for use by the thumb.  I have been using these buttons for shortcuts in games that make things a bit faster and easier than crawling over the keyboard with your hand.  As for the laser on this mouse, it is very accurate.  It feels much smoother than my previous mouse, due to having quadruple the DPI of it (3500 compared to 800).  This makes a huge difference in terms of stability and performance, even when just browsing the internet.Just to point out, there is definitely a learning curve on this mouse.  I was previously using a small Logitech notebook wireless mouse.  I wanted something better designed for gameplay so I bought the Deathadder.  It took me a good 24 hours or so to get used to the size of this mouse.  If you are used to a large mouse to begin with, it may take you less time than that before it becomes second nature.The driver download that can be found on Razer's website for this device includes a program that allows you to adjust settings like sensitivity and scroll wheel jumping distance.  I adjusted the sensitivity as well as the dpi and polling rate to the setting that best suited me.Overall, I love this device so far.  I will leave this review by saying that I will likely come back here to edit the review when I have more experience with the device or if I have any problems with the device and/or Razer's support (If I ever need to RMA it, etc...  I hope I won't).\n",

      "Great mouse ,the X5 has perfect button placement for my hand ,and it feels more comfortable them myold mouse. which was too small, and gave me a hand cramp when i used it for long periods of time.The mouse has worked flawlessly since i bought it . It's weight is about the same as anyother mouse i,vused,and in games it's more precise, When it comes to aiming and movement.I defendly Recommend to anyone looking for a gaming mouse, that is affordable and has a longlife span.Also, the two mouse buttons on the side of the mouse are alittle bit foward.

      "A gaming mouse is really a personal item.  For some a mouse could be perfect and for other it could be horrible.  It all depend on how you hold your mouse, technique you use, and playing style.The best way to describe this mouse is a basic high quality gaming mouse.  Basic means no extras/no side buttons.  Just your left/middle/right buttons + scroll.This mouse is slim, thats good for me because I like to rest the end of my palm on the mouse pad and use a high DPI + sensitivity while barley moving the mouse with only my figures in a claw formation.Since the mouse is slim it might not be good for people that rest their palm on the mouse (DeathAdder would be good for that).The one thing I did not like about this mouse is the led light will not turn off even if my computer is off. (unlike the DeathAdder, which has an option in the software to turn it off). The only way for the LED to be off was to either unplug the mouse or turn of the PSU.  I ended up opening the mouse and ripping the led out.Overall I think this is a good mouse and recommend it to anyone who understands this mouse is slimmer the other gaming mice.\n",

      "ok so this is a good idea and it worked great for about a day before it wouldnt stay in the holder which by the way i poorly designed. the mechanism that is supposed to lock in my vita to the holder does not lock it in well at all...all i have to do is simply push up on the corner of my vita and its already halfway out...and this is me not pushing hard at all i simply use my index finger use a little pressure and its out of the holder....i bought the cheapest version of the holder so i got the cheapest results should have known it was to good to be true...so my vita isnt locked down, i use a little pressure and it pops out, my vita is not secured very at all i shake the holder with the vita in it and the vita rocks back side to side....it feels great to rest my hands and fingers on the holder instead of them just dangling in the air or uncomfortably on the vita itself....if only the vita were more secure and wouldnt come out as easily i would love this thing to death but such is not the case\n",

      "PS Vita Travel PouchI bought the vita travel pouch right after I got my vita to help prevent scratches when I take my vita outside or on vacation. You open the pouch with a zipper revealing a piece of fabric in the middle. It divides the case into two sections. You put the vita in one side, I put the screen facing the fabric because it softer. On the other side are two mesh pockets for accessories. On the fabric that divides the case are four slots for vita game cards. The case also has a little hook which a strap can be attached too.The case is very durable and protects the vita perfectly.\n",

      "Though Nintendo is pretty much killing the handheld market with the 3DS right now, I'm a Sony gal, so I decided to get a PS Vita first. I'm so glad I did. I purchased the Crystal White version a while back, when it was first bundled with Assassin's Creed Liberation. I purchased a pink rubber case to protect it, and I also have the Persona 4 Golden skin placed on the front panel, which has a built in screen protector.The Vita is an amazing machine, it's powerful, with a gorgeous screen. I take my Vita with me everywhere and though it isn't so compact, it fits well in my purse and it hasn't gotten scratched up by all the other things in my bag, so it seems pretty sturdy to me. The Vita's battery life is amazing, I can go days without charging it and it'll just turn on like normal. I especially like the sleep feature on the Vita; it makes RPGs a lot less worrisome because you can just pause the whole system and pick your game back up whenever you're ready.The biggest downside to the Vita is the proprietary memory cards. Vitas can't function without them and if you have PS Plus, like I do, you'll have 20+ free games in a manner of months, with no space to add them too. I highly recommend buying a 32 GB (or 64 GB) memory card, if you plan on keeping your Vita long term. They run at about $80 ($120 if you want to import a 64 GB), but there are sales on them frequently. I got my 32 GB here for about $60.Now games~! I am an RPG fan so I am literally overwhelmed by the number of RPGs I have access to that are just for Vita. If you add in the games on the PSN, that's PS1 and PS2 RPGs, plus games that are cross-play/cross-buy for the PS3. There are lots of games to play on Vita and in my entire gaming life, I've never had a backlog of games to play until I purchased one.My Top 5 Vita Games:1. Persona 4 Golden2. Tearaway3. Soul Sacrifice4. Ragnarok Odyssey5. Assassin's Creed Liberation HDSome honorable mentions are Uncharted Golden Abyss, Virtue's Last Reward (also on 3DS), God's Eater Burst (PSP game), and FF Dissida 012 (PSP game). All and all, I am completely happy with my purchase. I have such a backlog of games that I haven't even tried some of the new Vita releases like Muramasa's Rebirth and Dragon's Crown. There are many more games to come for the Vita, so even though it may not be doing as well as the 3DS, it can certainly hold its own. It's worth every penny I spent on it.Also! The Vita is region-free, so that means players can buy Japanese Vita games that aren't localized in the Western markets and play them without any sort of hacking or complications. It does, however, require a second memory card to save the foreign game data on.\n",

      "I am heavy PS3 users but only a casual PSP / Vita user but this grip is going to make me a more likely Vita gamer because it gives the Vita the feel close to a DualShock 3 controller's while preserving all of Vita's gaming enhancements such as the back-rub capability.I love this add-on for the following reasons:- lets me hold the Vita in a near-familiar way I do a PS3 controller- it's easy to snap the Vita in and out of  it- appears to be durable and does not leave marks or scratches on the Vita- offers access to all the buttons and controls using during gameplayBut nothing can be perfect and the price for all of the above is that I need to pop the Vita out every time I have to charge it or to change to a different game. This is okay for me because I'm a casual Vita player but it may be an issue for the more hard-core. On the other hand, the hard-core players may not need/want to use this at all. I noticed that our kid who's been using a PSP for the past couple of years appears to be quite comfortable with the Vita 'as is' - his reaction was 'oh... neat' but after using the grip a couple of times he didn't bother snapping it back in after he had to separate it from the Vita when changing a game.To conclude, this is a five-star item for me. My kid would probably rate it as a 3-star but he's not the one that's using it.\n",

      "If you're not very patient this charger is not for you. Not only must you initially charge the batteries for 24 hours, but the charger is the old-fashioned direct-contact charger. Therefore contact to the battery may be slightly difficult.If you're a fan of monetary efficiency, this charger is your best friend. Not only is it low in cost, but you get two rechargeable batteries and you get a USB connection to the back of the Wii or Wii U. In WiiConnect24 Standby Mode the charger stays on, allowing you to charge the Wii Remotes while the Wii is \"off.\"I love this charger as I'm not the aforementioned impatient type. I think you'll love this thing.\n",

      "I don't understand all of the negative reviews on this product.  I bought both of my enegizer chargers about a year ago, and they have worked just fine. These chargers are so much better that the NYKO chargers I used when I first bought my Wii.  I have never had to replace any of these batteries, just have to charge them.  I recommend these chargers to anyone who is looking to \"go green\" and save on battery life. Best charger out there.\n",

      "I got this quite some time ago and was wondering why the charger packs were not charging while it was plugged in and the remotes in exact position! There was some problems with some of these chargers that did not charge due to some defect where the little button thing on the station that presses against the charger didn't always make contact with the remote, which seemed to be my case.I dumped it and simply rely on regular brand name rechargable batteries and my Duracell AA/AAA 4 battery charger instead as I did before I purchased this. I only did buy the charger to see if it would have been more convenient but it was more of a hassle to me.Read up on reviews and stuff before switching from a normal battery charger before buying this, because it may be more trouble than it should be.\n",
